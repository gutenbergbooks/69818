<p class='c013'><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpent [<i>Subject</i> of the following
Sheets,] being one part of your
celebrated and expensive Collection
of Rarities, naturally leads me to beg the
Honour of your Name to grace its Entrance
into the publick World.</p>

<p class='c013'>I can’t enter into the vanity of thinking,
that the Book can be any improvement to
one who has been so long and laborious an
Enquirer after Truth, and penetrated so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>into the Empire of Nature: but as in Divinity,
a willing Mind; so in Learning, the
best Endeavour will be accepted. And tho’
the Book cannot recommend it self to you,
your Name may recommend it to others.</p>

<p class='c013'>Happy are the Times, when Knowledge
is the study of those who have superior Abilities
for it: Happy therefore is the present
Age, that has you, among many other Learned,
so eminent an Encourager of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tho’ elevated Minds direct all their concern
to what they <i>should be</i>, and not to any
Applause for what they <i>really are</i>; yet, if
to delineate their Excellency be offensive to
Modesty, the Sincerity with which it is done,
will, it is hoped, secure their Pardon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, what is it that makes the great Character,
but Knowledge in all its diversity, a
Sollicitousness for the Spread of Arts and
Sciences, excelling in one’s particular Station
of Life, and being divinely forward to all
the high Offices of Humanity? This is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>Picture of real Worth, and what can forbid to
say, that Sir <span class='sc'>Hans Sloane</span> is the Life?</p>

<p class='c013'>That you may long continue the Restorer
of Health, the Ornament of the Day,
and in triumph over all the deadly Power
of the <i>Old Serpent</i>, at last possess eternal
Health, are the most sincere Wishes of him,
who with a just Sense of Obligation, and the
greatest Regards, is,</p>
<p class='c014'><i>SIR</i>,</p>
<p class='c015'><i>Your most humble</i>,</p>
<p class='c016'><i>and devoted Servant</i>,</p>

<p class='c013'><i>The Divine Wisdom so variously displayed in the Works of
Nature, even the lowest Order of them, entertains the human
Eye with Prospects exquisitely beautiful and pleasurable:
As our Knowledge is defective, we are at a loss how
to account perfectly for the particular Ends of their Formation, and
Manner of their Subserviency to the Whole of the Eternal Design.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>However, by Observation and Improvements in Natural
Philosophy, we are assured thus far; that as the Almighty Creator
made nothing in vain, so all his Works are good, and admirably fitted
to answer the Purposes of his Will, and that his Wisdom, like
his tender Mercies, shines through all the Systems of his Creatures.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>That there is not a wise Purpose in every thing that is made,
because we do not understand it, is as absurd as for a Man to say,
there is no such thing as Light, because he is blind, and has no Eyes
to see it.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>For the Illustration of this, we may take a short View of
Creatures, in vulgar account too diminutive and despicable a Species,
to deserve a close Attention: And among these, if we consider the
Noxious, we shall find, if not an Argument why they should be made,
yet we shall be able to discern no Reason why they should not, because
their Noxiousness is not so unavoidable, but that we may, and almost
every one does avoid it.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span><i>General Histories of these Kinds we have been
furnished with in the Writings of the Learned: Here I apply myself
to the Discussion of one</i> particular Species, <i>viz.</i> the Serpent: <i>in which
I don’t pretend to new Discoveries, but only to collect, and bring into
one View, what has been said by different Persons, which is not to be
found by any without</i> many Books, <i>and</i> much Time; <i>and which,
without the present</i> English <i>Dress, would not be understood by others
at all</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>In accounting for some things relative to the Subject, I have always
chosen the Words of the Learned in the Physical Profession.</i>
<i>The Subject being like</i> Dust, <i>the</i> Food of the Serpent, very dry,
<i>I have endeavoured to give it some Agreeableness, by a Variety of
Passages from History, and Reflections of many kinds; which, though

  <h2 class='c029'>PART I.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c030' />
<h3 class='c001'>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class='c031'>I begin with the Division of Serpents, which I distribute
into <i>Terrestrial</i>, that live upon Land only;
<i>Aquatick</i>, that live in Water; and <i>Amphibious</i>, that
inhabit both Elements. Under these I comprehend
all the Relatives to the venomous Tribe. But how
can Land-Serpents live in Water? I answer, their Bodies are
equally formed for both Places.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among Animals, some breathe by <i>Lungs</i>, and others by <i>Gills</i>,
as all sanguineous Fish, (excepting the <i>Whale</i>.) By <i>Gills</i>, I mean
those membranous cartilaginous Parts on both sides the Head,
whereby they hear and respire: What we call <i>Gills</i> in Fish, are
properly their <i>Lungs</i>. Respiration (which is an involuntary Motion
of the Breast, whereby Air is alternately taken in and thrown
out) is as necessary to Fish as to Land-Animals: In Water, is a
great Quantity of Air inclosed, and it is that Air they respire, and
by their <i>Gills</i> they separate the Air from the Water, and present
it to the <i>Blood</i>, after the same manner as ’tis presented to the
Lungs of Land-Animals.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The <i>Gills</i> of Fish have an alternate Motion of Dilatation and
Compression; when they <i>dilate</i> their <i>Gills</i>, the Water is taken
in; when they <i>contract</i> them, ’tis expelled again. Thus the
Water is carried in by the Mouth, and carried off again (stript
of its Air) by the <i>Gills</i>, which perform the Office of Lungs. Their
sucking Water is Breathing, and their Food as little of Water,
perhaps, as other Creatures use.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>SERPENTS</i> will swim in all Liquids; this appears in the
Experiment made by a <i>learned Italian</i>, who put a Serpent into a
large Glass-Vessel of Wine, where it lived swimming about six
Hours: and when it was by force immersed and kept under that
Liquid, it lived only about an Hour and a half. He put another
in common Water, where it lived three Days; but when
it was kept under Water, it lived only about twelve Hours<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Some Serpents are reptitious, creep on the Belly, and some
have Feet; the Form of their Legs is peculiar and different in
divers Species, whence the slow Motion of some, and wonderful
Agility and Swiftness in others: Their Feet are some cloven (as it
were) into Hoofs, others divided into Claws, with Variety of different
Nails to answer the several Purposes of Life; among them
are <i>Flying Serpents</i>: for which purpose, they are furnished with
Wings to buoy themselves up in the fluid Air, whereby they
keep their Bodies on a due Balance in their Motion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Serpents are provided with Tails of different Length
and Size; these also are necessary to adjust their Motion, and
guard them against Stimulation of Flies. In winged Serpents, the
Tail serves as a Rudder to govern them in flying through the Air;
and, in the marine Serpents, they serve as Oars. But another says,
the flying of a Bird, in effect, is quite a different Motion from
the sailing of a Ship: Birds don’t vibrate their Wings towards the
Tail, as Oars are struck towards the Stern, but waft them downward;
nor does the Tail of the Bird cut the Air at right Angles
as the Rudder does the Water, but it is disposed horizontally, and
preserves the same Situation what way soever the Bird turns<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>They are painted with variety of Colours, as red, black,
white, brown, green; the Composition of these, in some of their
Garnitures, forms Beauties exquisitely fine. Some of them have
very little Eyes, others large ones: Some wound with their Teeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>others with the Tail that terminates in a Sting, which is an
Apparatus in the Body of certain Insects like a little Lance,
serving them as a Weapon of Offence. Mention is made by
Historians of harmless Serpents, and of Persons who have tamed
Serpents, and whose Hair has been kissed by a tame Dragon, and
which, with its Tongue, gently lick’d its Master’s Face<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Serpent seems to be one of the distinguished Favourites
of the Air, seeing it subsists by aerial Food all Winter; that is, in
those Regions where it dare not turn Ranger. Sleep is the Nurse
of Nature, a Nurse that greatly indulges the animal Spirits, and,
by arresting voluntary Motion, prevents their daily Consumption,
and, at the same time, allows the perpetual Motion of the Arteries,
Veins, Heart. We know but little of the real peculiar
Nature of what we call Air, only that it is the most heterogeneous
Body in the World, a kind of secondary Chaos, being a Compound
of minute Particles of various Kinds, Earth, Water, Minerals,
Vegetables, Animals, <i>&amp;c.</i> collected either by solar or artificial
Heat.</p>

<p class='c013'>These Particles together constitute an Appendage to our
Earth, called Atmosphere; or that thin, elastick, fluid Mass, wherein
we live, move, and have our being; which Air we continually
receive, and expel by Respiration, and no Animal can live, or
Vegetable grow without it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus Serpents inclosed in the Receiver, are immediately
(I may say) starved when deprived of Air, which is their only
Winter-Food.—<i>N. B.</i> Whatever is put in a Receiver so exhausted,
is said to be put <i>in Vacuo</i>: Animals that have two Ventricles,
and no <i>Foramen Ovale</i>, as Birds, Dogs, Cats, Mice,
die in it in less than half a Minute; a Mole died in one Minute;
a Bat lived seven or eight; Insects, as Wasps, Bees, Grashoppers,
seem dead in two Minutes<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor will any Vegetation proceed <i>in Vacuo</i>, or without Air:
Seeds planted will not grow. <span class='sc'>Objection.</span> <i>Beans grow in Vacuo.</i>
I answer, they grow a little tumid, but that kind of Vegetation
is only owing to the Dilatation of the Air within them;
they swell a little by the Expansion of the Air, but they never
bud.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Among the Ancients were very strange Notions about the <i>Original</i>
of Serpents, and other Animals: <i>Bees</i>, says a certain Orator,
Historian, and Philosopher, were bred from the Carcass of
Oxen; <i>Wasps</i> from the Corruptions of Horses; <i>Beetles</i> from Asses;
and <i>Serpents</i> from human Marrow: Hence they consecrated a
Dragon to Kings and Princes, as a Creature peculiar to Man<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c019'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>I don’t know how to form an Apology for the old Philosophers,
whose Account of spontaneous Generation is perfectly romantick:
What can be more so, than to say Frogs are engendered
of Slime, or in the Clouds, and dropt down in the Showers of
Rain? So the <i>Egyptians</i> said, that Mice were produced from
the Mud of <i>Nilus</i>, and Insects from putrified Matter animated by
the Sun. The Principle of this equivocal Generation, was the
old Doctrine of <i>Egypt</i>, and now justly exploded, as contrary to
Reason and common Sense, as well as to the Design of the
Creator in making Animals Male and Female; the End of which
Difference in Sexes, all Animals exactly answer, as if they were
endued with human Reason. No Woman more tender of her
Babe, or careful in providing for it, than Animals are of their
Young Ones.</p>
<hr class='c030' />
<h3 class='c001'>SECTION II.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The knowledge of mere Animals (who have no School for
Arts and Sciences) is most surprising; these without visible
Instructors, know how to perpetuate their Species to the End of
the World; and how to order their Eggs, as those, who are apprized,
their Successors were contained in them, and that it was
in their power to produce them, and to perpetuate, or keep up
the Name of their Family.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpentine Animals are thus taught by Nature; these
differ in the Mode of Propagation; some of them are <i>viviparous</i>,
an Epithet applied to such Animals, who lay their Eggs
within their Bellies, who bring forth their Young Ones alive and
perfect, as Vipers, Sheep, Hares; others are <i>oviparous</i>, and bring
forth their Young from Eggs, as Serpents, Snakes, Lizards,
Frogs, Salmon, Tortoise, Herrings, <i>&amp;c.</i><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Omnia ab ovo animalia.</i></p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>In this Contrivance of Male and Female, and different Method
of Multiplication for perpetuating the Species, we may see an
admirable Instance of divine Wisdom: But for this Difference in
Sexes, there would be no Increase of Serpents nor other Animals.
The oviparous and viviparous Manner of Propagation is as wonderful;
for,</p>

<p class='c013'>Were they all <i>viviparous</i>, that is, brought forth living Births,
there would be but a small Number, and not sufficient to support
the whole animal Body: Corn, Grass, Fruits, <i>&amp;c.</i> are no Production
of the Sea, therefore can be no Food for Fish: The Almighty
Creator so ordained it, that they should feed one upon
another; and this made it necessary that they should be <i>oviparous</i>,
that they might increase in great Plenty, which they could not do,
if they were of the <i>viviparous</i> Kind; that is, brought forth their
living Offspring, as Vipers, Sheep, Hares, Cows do.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Fish being <i>oviparous</i>, propagating their Kind by Eggs,
which, for Number, are infinite, their Progeny is innumerable,
and sufficient to support all the Branches of the Marine Family;
even the lesser Kind of Fish send forth an incredible Number of
Spawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, if four-footed Beasts were propagated by
Eggs, they would soon cover the Face of the Earth, without a
daily Destruction of them, which would take up no little time,
tho’ an <i>Army of Nimrods</i> were employed. Birds increase by Eggs,
and bring forth great Numbers; and perhaps, for this reason,
that Birds of Prey and Serpents, Kitchens, <i>&amp;c.</i> might not want
proper Supplies. Now, if a Female Bird was great with six or
twelve Young Ones at once, the Burden would be intolerable, her
Wings would fail, and she would become an easy Prey to her
Enemies.</p>

<p class='c013'>But you will say, what if they brought forth only one or two
at a time, till they amounted to the usual Number of their Eggs?
I answer, that then they would be troubled all the Year long
with feeding their Young, or bearing them in their Womb.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Production of Creatures by Eggs, is a wonderful Phænomenon
in the animal World; the Eggs are shelly and hard, to
preserve the included Embryo from Accidents, and to contain
suitable Nutriment for it. ’Tis observable that Chickens, while in
their dark embryotick State, are nourished by the <i>White</i> alone, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>grown big, and then feed on the <i>Yolk</i>, as the stronger Diet; and,
when that is consumed, the Shell opens, and lets out the Prisoners.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though all Fowl are hatched from Eggs, yet it is not always
by the Parent’s Incubation, or Brooding, but by some other
Warmth: The <i>Tortoise</i> is said to lay no less than fifteen hundred
Eggs, which she covers in the Sand, and leaves the Sun to hatch
them. The Eggs of the <i>Ostrich</i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a> are hatched after the same manner;
so the Serpent lays, and leaves her Eggs in the Dunghill.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Job</i> xxxix. 14, 15. <i>Willoughby’s Ornithol.</i>
<i>lib.</i> ii. <i>cap.</i> 8.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Eggs</i> of Serpents, and certain other Animals, are Parts
formed in the Ovaries of the Female, covered with a Shell, which
includes an Embryo of the same Species. In the days of old, the
Egg was the Symbol of the World; the World, by Tradition, being
made of an <i>Egg</i>: Hence Eggs became of singular Importance
in the Sacrifices of <i>Cybele</i> the Mother of the Gods. Some
of the Pagan Deities were said to be produced from Eggs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some Parts of <i>Asia</i>, and at <i>Grand Cairo</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, they hatch
their Chickens in Ovens; each Oven contains several thousand
Eggs which the Country brings in, and have their Eggs returned
in Chickens.</p>

<p class='c013'>By this Method, they generally want some integral Part, as
an Eye, a Claw, <i>&amp;c.</i> which may be owing to a Want of equal
Impression of Heat, tho’ the artificial Warmth be continued.
There are thousands, yea Millions at a Batch, thus produced in
<i>Egyptian Ovens</i>;—and may as well be in <i>Europe</i>, if our Bakers
had the knack on’t. An Experiment has been made by a <i>Duke of
Tuscany</i>, who having built such Ovens, did produce living Chickens
in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under this <i>Section</i>, I shall consider the wonderful Sagacity
of Serpents, in chusing their Paths for Deambulation, and finding
out proper Receptacles for their Repose and Security in Winter;
and that in Climates that are Opposites in their Nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Summer, generally speaking, they are found in solitary and
unfrequented dry Situations; others delight in moorish fenny
Grounds; and in hot Countries, near to Groves, Rivulets—These,
like other Animals, strictly adhere to the Constitutions of their
Family, without Deviation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>They take up their Winter-Quarters in Caverns, hollow
Places, Burrows, Rocks, old Hedges, and under the Roots of
Vegetables, especially the Birch, others say Beech-Trees, which
were consecrated by the Pagans to the supreme Numen.</p>

<p class='c013'>In these lonesome Habitations they repose themselves during
the Winter, in a kind of sleepy State, as half dead, with <i>open

<p class='c013'>It argues no little Penetration, that they know when and
how to shelter themselves in Places of Safety in all Seasons; and
what is yet more astonishing, is, that they live there so many
Months without Food and without Action; and when released
from their hybernal Confinement, how soon do they find out
their appointed Food? Taken in this light, they are not singular;
for ’tis believed, there are other Animals that pass the Winter-Season
in a state of Indolence and Inactivity, as Cuckows and
Swallows, making way by their Retreat for Woodcocks and
Fieldfares, which visit us in Winter, and then return northwards:
They are said to breed in colder Countries, as <i>Norway</i>, <i>Russia</i>,
<i>Sweden</i>, and the <i>Islands of Orcades</i>, the most northern Parts of
<i>Scotland</i>; which Islands were formerly in possession of the <i>Norwegians</i>,
and given and annex’d to <i>Scotland</i> by <i>Christiern</i> I. King
of <i>Denmark</i> and <i>Norway</i>, on the Marriage of his Daughter <i>Margaret</i>,
with <i>James</i> III. King of <i>Scotland</i>, about the Year 1474.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is probable, that when these northern Countries are buried in
Snow, and their Rivers are frozen up, these Birds take their Flight
hither, and such like Places, where they have access to Water, <i>&amp;c.</i>
But as to Cuckows and Swallows, as intimated above, ’tis generally
allow’d that they sleep in Winter, having, as ’tis said, been found
in hollow Trees and Caverns. Nor is this at all unlikely; tho’
on the other hand, I can see no Absurdity in supposing that these
should go upon a Summer, as the other do upon a Winter Pilgrimage;
that these pursue a lesser Heat, as well as the others fly
from a greater Cold. Yea, <i>Vegetables</i> are said to <i>sleep in Winter</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and to be awake and lively in Summer: During the Months of
their Rest, a quantity of Oil is laid up in them for their Defence
against the Cold, and in proportion to the Degrees of it, which
they are to sustain; whence it is, that the Trees of the northern
Climates so much abound with Oil.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, there are <i>Reptiles</i> and <i>Insects</i> that have
Sense enough to lay up Winter-Store in Summer, as the <i>Bee</i>,
<i>Wasp</i>, <i>Field-Mouse</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> a Property foreign to the ancient House
of Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Summer, the <i>Bees</i> labor hard for Winter Provision: As
soon as the Air grows mild and warm, they are out betimes, and
gather their Harvest from the Simples of the Fields, which they
suck into their Bodies, and upon their Return to the Hive they
disgorge it, as Pigeons do their Food wherewith they feed their
Young. When the Bees have fill’d their Storehouse with the Delicacies
of Nature, they lock the Doors, which they seal up with
delicate white Wax, to prevent the Emanation of the Honey,
which is a vegetable Juice: The Combs in which their Treasure
is lodg’d, are geometrically nice, and exceed the most exquisite
Art of Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Ants also in this respect, are remarkable for Penetration
and Foresight. In <i>America</i> are Ants which raise Hillocks four or
five Foot high, and have such a way of cementing the Earth
about them, that ’tis as firm as Lime and Stone, which protects
them against the <i>Ant-Bears</i>, or Pismire-eaters; <i>i. e.</i> a kind of
Creatures as big as Dogs, that feed on these Insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>One observes, that the <i>Spaniards</i> left <i>Jamaica</i>, and went to
<i>Cuba</i>, for this Reason among others, because their Childrens Eyes
were eaten by these Ants, when left by themselves in the
Cradle<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ceylon in the <i>East-Indies</i> produces several sorts of remarkable
Ants, particularly a large red kind, which make their Nests on
the Boughs of great Trees, with Leaves wrapt together in Clusters,
in which they lay their Eggs: And another sort call’d <i>Vacos</i>,
whose Hinder-part is white, and the Head red; these swarm
over the Land and devour every thing, but Stone and Iron: They
creep on House-walls, and always build an Arch over themselves;
on these their Poultry live chiefly; some of them bite desperately.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>To these I might add the <i>Wasps</i>, that have their Winter-Treasures
in subterranean Cells, and the Field-mice that know
the proper Season to gather Acorns, which they carefully hide
in hollow Places, (as Mole-runs) in the Earth. Thus we see
no Creatures so mean in our View, but a Ray of divine Wisdom
shines in their Foresight and Contrivance: When we consider
how wonderfully these inferior Creatures are conducted in their
Operations, how punctually they obey the Laws of their Creator,
how solicitously every one propagates his Kind, and makes proper
Provisions for his Family; it looks as if it were done by some
Principle that’s more perfect than the common Reason of Man.
Nevertheless ’tis past doubt, that Brutes of the highest Order,
and most refin’d, are but Brutes, <i>i. e.</i> irrational, and it’s well for
us they are so.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is call’d <i>Instinct</i>, a natural Disposition, or Sagacity
wherewith Animals are endued; by virtue whereof they are enabled
to provide for themselves, know what is good for them,
and are determin’d to propagate and preserve their Species. <i>Instinct</i>
bears some Analogy to Reason or Understanding, and supplies
the Defect of it in Brutes. The Narrative of <i>Eve</i>’s Temptation
begins with affirming, <i>The Serpent was more subtle than any
Beast of the Field</i>. And <i>Christ</i> recommends the Wisdom of the
Serpent, but not without the Innocence of the Dove.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Proofs of its Subtilty are not so obvious; some produce
such as these, telling us, that the Serpent <i>Cerastes</i> hides itself in
the Sand, with a view to bite the Horse’s Foot that he might
throw the Rider. <i>Jacob</i> seems to allude to this, in the Blessing
he gave to <i>Dan</i>, of whom ’tis said, <i>Dan shall be a Serpent by
the Way, an Adder in the Path, that bites the Horse’s Heels, so
that his Rider shall fall backward</i>. Gen. xlix. 17. But more in

vast Numbers of winged Serpents are annually bred in <i>Arabia</i>,
from whence, at certain Seasons, Swarms of them take their flight
across the <i>Red-Sea</i> into <i>Egypt</i>: Upon the first notice of their Arrival,
the <i>Ibidian</i> Birds assemble in Troops, and immediately fly

<p class='c013'><i>ICHNEUMON</i> is a little Animal of bold Spirit, and a
great Destroyer of Serpents, and therefore the <i>Egyptians</i> keep it
in their Houses, as we do Cats; and the young ones are commonly
sold for that end at <i>Alexandria</i>. In form it resembles an
overgrown Rat, and is called the <i>Indian-Rat</i>, and <i>Pharaoh’s
Rat</i>; and by its mighty Atchievements, it must be of some considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Bulk; for in its Encounters with great Dogs, Crocodiles,
Serpents, <i>&amp;c.</i> it generally comes off victorious: Upon their Approach
it bunches up, and bristles up its Hair, in token of Defiance:
It couches on the Ground, and leaps like a Bull-dog at
its Prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>By some it is call’d the <i>Egyptian Otter</i>; ’tis of a dun Colour,
has round Ears, black Legs, and long Tail: It cannot endure the
Wind, and runs for Shelter, when it rises, sometimes thrusting
its Head between its hinder Legs, in a round Form like a Hedge-hog.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who have examined into Kites Nests, have found
Vipers in them, which are supposed to be Food for their young
ones. In <i>China</i> is a little Creature like a Weezel, called <i>Magaure</i>,
that is a mortal Enemy to Serpents, which it kills by striking its
Teeth into their Heads. The <i>Chameleon</i> trembles at the Sight of

<p class='c013'>Whether the Serpent hates Man more than other Creatures,
is with me a question; be that as it will, it is wonderful
to think, that notwithstanding Man’s and other Creatures invincible
Hatred of Serpents, yet hitherto they have been able to support
themselves in a State of War against all the World.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even among Vegetables are found Enemies to Serpents; as
the <i>Dittany</i> of <i>Virginia</i>, or the <i>wild Penny-royal</i>; the Leaves of
which, says my Author, being bruised, we tied in the Cleft of a
long Stick, and held them to the Nose of the <i>Rattle-Snake</i>, who
by turning and wriggling, laboured hard to avoid it, and in half
an hour’s time was kill’d by it: This was done <i>July</i> 1657, at
which Season those Creatures are computed to be in the greatest
Vigour of their Poison; it is also remarkable, that in those Places
where the <i>wild Penny-royal</i> grows, no Rattle-Snakes are observed
to come<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c019'><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c031'>That <i>Dust</i> was not the original Food of the Serpent,
seems evident from the Sentence passed upon the Paradisaic
Serpent, but the necessary Consequence of the Change made
in the manner of its Motion, <i>i. e.</i> the prone Posture of its Body,
by which it’s doomed to live upon Food intermix’d with Earth,
dried to a Powder; <i>Dust shalt thou eat</i>, is one part of the Curse.
It’s true, Serpents eat Flesh, Birds, Frogs, Fish, Fruits, Grass,
but as they continually creep on the Earth, ’tis impossible but
their Food must be often defiled with Dirt; some of them may
eat Earth out of Necessity, or at least Earth-Worms, which they
cannot swallow without some Dirt with them. No Animal but
has its proper Food; even the most minute Insects; those that
seemingly feed upon Dust, in reality feed only upon some nutritive
Particles therein. Insects have been seen through a Microscope
to eat some Particles of Dust, and reject many others, having
accurate Organs of Sight, Smelling, and Feeling, as well accommodated
to Dust, as the Organs of Ducks and Hogs are to
find their Food in Dirt.</p>

<p class='c013'>And here it may be observed, that what the Serpent does
through a Necessity from the Divine Sentence, the earthly Man
does from his own Will; the Serpent only by the Will of another,
Man eats it from his own Inclination to it; the Serpent
would have better Food if it could, Man might have better and
will not: This shews that Man has a mind to be Companion with
the Serpent, and to carry on the Acquaintance, that was begun
in Paradise; the Serpent licks the Dust materially, the earthly
Person licks it morally; the one has its Tongue upon it, the other
has his Heart. The earthly Man is only a Man in shape, but a
Serpent in Practice: What is the Punishment of the Serpent, is
made the Happiness of the earthly Mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some Serpents are <i>carnivorous</i>, and feed on Flesh; others
are <i>verminivorous</i>, and feed on Reptiles: Their Sustenance is various,
suited to their several Constitutions, and Nature of the
Climates, where they inhabit. Vipers and Adders feed on Herbs,
Weeds, Dews, as well as upon Lizards, Mice, Frogs.—When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>they take Food into their Mouths, they raise up their Bodies a
little, that they may swallow their Prey with less difficulty.
They swallow those little Animals whole without chewing.
In a Viper dissected by a certain Gentleman, he found three large
Mice, intire, without any Change of their Form by hard Compressure.
<i>Scorpions</i> live chiefly upon Locusts, and other winged
Insects. In <i>Arabia</i>, ’tis said, they feed upon <i>Balsam-Juices</i>, and
seem to delight much in the Shadow of that Tree<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c019'><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is remarkable, that Nature has provided young Vipers with
poisonous Teeth grown to Perfection, commensurate to their
Bulk, that so they may immediately feed themselves, by being
able, in some measure, to kill their Prey as soon as they are born.
Some of these Animals have temporary Parts, as the <i>Lacerta
Aquatica</i>, a little Water-Serpent, which, when young, has four
ramified Fins, to poise and keep its Body upright, (which gives
it the Resemblance of a young Fish) and these fall off when the
Legs are grown: So Frogs and Toads, in their <i>Tadpole State</i>, have
Tails, which fall off when their Legs are grown out<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c019'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. These
pass through various Transmigrations, before they arrive at their

<p class='c031'>As Serpents differ in Kind, so in Size; the Length to which

is sent out with little Bodies; others are of monstrous Bulk,

<p class='c013'>In places adjacent to <i>Batavia</i>, a <i>Dutch</i> Settlement in the <i>East-Indies</i>,
we read of Serpents 50 Feet long; and the Skin of one,
which was 20 Feet long, that swallowed an <i>Infant</i>, is shewn in
<i>Batavia</i>, the <i>Metropolis</i> of the <i>Dutch</i> Empire in the <i>East-Indies</i>.
In <i>America</i> also are Serpents of prodigious Bulk, from 25, to 30
Feet long<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c019'><sup>[27]</sup></a>; but this Subject will be further considered in the
<i>Second Part</i> of this Book.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, there are Serpents, as remarkably little as
the <i>Amphisbæna</i>, <i>Gallic</i> Viper, and some of the Lizards, that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not above four or six Inches long. Most of these Minutillos vary
in outward Form.</p>

<p class='c013'>And here, I can’t but observe that as the Magnitude of some
other Animals is very wonderful, so, on the contrary, the Minuteness
of some is equally astonishing, if not more so: There are
some very <i>little Insects</i> that are conspicuous to the Eye, but more
that are <i>invisible</i> without the Help of a <i>Microscope</i>, which is an
optical Instrument, that magnifies Objects, and makes them bigger
than really they are; it helps to discover minute Particles, of
which Bodies are composed, and the curious Contexture of
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>To those who are not used to a rigid mathematic Proof, this
may be illustrated by the Smallness of many organized Bodies.
There is a Plant called <i>Harts-Tongue</i>, ten thousand Seeds of which
hardly make the Bulk of a Pepper-Corn. Now the Cover of the
true Body of each Seed, the parenchymous and ligneous Parts of
both; the Fibres of those Parts, the Principles of those Fibres, and
the homogeneous Particles or Atoms of each Principle, being moderately
multiplied one by another, afford a hundred thousand
Millions of formed Atoms in the space of a Pepper-Corn, says the
learned Dr. <i>Grew</i><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c019'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The same is yet more evident from the Stupendous Smallness
of some Animals, especially in the Sperm of smaller Insects;
which have been observed by Mr. <i>Leeuwenhoek</i>, to be some Millions
of times smaller than a grain Sand. This learned Gentleman
has observed more of them in the Spawn of a Cod-fish, than
there are People living on the Face of all the Earth at once<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c019'><sup>[29]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Apparatus in Serpents for their Motion is admirable.
How curious the Structure of their Muscles, and their
Junction to every Point, whereby they are prepared for their different
Motions, and enabled to move according to their different
Nature and Situation!</p>

<p class='c013'>In those that go upon their Bellies, the Movement is very singular,
which is in a Form curvilineal, different winding of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Bodies. The Serpentine Line, among Mathematicians, is borrowed
from the Foldings of a Serpent in its Motion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Learned observe, there is a great deal of geometrical
Niceness in the sinuous Motion of Snakes, Vipers, and other Serpents;
to assist them in the right Management of it, the annular
Scales under their Bodies are very remarkable, lying cross the Belly,
contrary to what those in the Back, and the rest of the System do;
which Contrivance facilitates their Motion.
This tortuous creeping Motion of the Reptile Species is very
curious: The whole Body of a Worm is, as it were, but a Chain
of annular or spiral Muscles, whose round Fibres, by contracting,
make each Ring more strong. The Back-Bones of Serpents are
a wonderful Composition: How thick are they with Joints? How
numerous and strong are their co-operating Muscles? By this curious
Articulation of the Joints, they can turn and wind their Bodies
any way without any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Outside of their Skin is a most elegant Composition: to a
common Eye, their Tegument has a rugged uneven Aspect; but,
to a proper Judge, the Scales of Vipers are found to be a most exquisite
Piece of Mechanism; the Symmetry of the whole is geometrically
exact, and vastly beautiful; not imitable by human Skill:
Some of them are guarded by a coverture not penetrable by a
human Arm, which is their Security in a perilous Situation; yea,
a greater Security than many innocent Inhabitants of the Field
are privileged with. Among Serpents, some are clothed as with
a Coat of Mail, <i>i. e.</i> an Armature of strong Scales; and such of
them as want that crustaceous Covering, have either a Sting in the
Tail, or a Tooth in their Mouth, that bids the Assailant keep off,
and observe his Distance.</p>
<hr class='c030' />
<h3 class='c001'>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class='c031'>What is Poison? I answer, that, generally speaking, ’tis
taken to be a malignant Quality in some Vegetables,
Minerals, and Animals, a small Quantity of which is hurtful,
and even mortal, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The Learned in the Faculty tell us, <i>Poisons</i> operate in various
manners; some by dissolving the Blood, others by coagulating it,
and some by corroding and destroying the Solids. The Learned
Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i> says, “Some attack equally all Parts, some only
a particular one. Thus the <i>Lepus Marinus</i> is an Enemy to
the Lungs, <i>Cantharides</i> to the Bladder<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c019'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.”</p>
<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>His Voyage.</i></p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Some Vegetables again, which prove Poison to Man, serve
for Food to other Animals. Thus, says that learned Gentleman,
<i>Mandragora</i> and <i>Jusquiamnus</i> that feed Hogs, kill Man.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>HEMLOCK</i>, that is hurtful to Man, is wholesome for
Goats; yea, the <i>Cassavi Plant</i> poisons unprepared; but prepared,
is the very Bread of the <i>West-Indians</i>, particularly <i>Jamaica</i> and
the hotter Parts, with which they victual Ships. <i>Ibid.</i> Tea is
said to be poisonous before it is cured.</p>

<p class='c013'>This perhaps may serve to obviate an Objection made against
the Goodness of the Deity, in planting a Tree in Paradise that
had such malignant Influences; because, supposing that it had any
Properties, which might tend to the Dissolution of the human
System, yet the same Tree might be very salutary and useful to
other Beings in the Creation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having divided <i>Poison</i> into <i>Three Parts</i>, I shall, in the next
Place consider them distinctly.</p>
<p class='c033'>I. <i>This Contrivance of Divine Wisdom is so universal, that
we find, in the vegetable Kingdom, something more than what is
merely analogous to Poison, both in Land and Water-Plants</i>; as
the <i>Napellus</i>, <i>Cassivi</i>, <i>Nux Vomica</i>, <i>Aconite</i>, <i>Cicuta Aquatica</i>,
<i>Solanum Lethale</i>, <i>Aconitum Hyemale</i>. Some Poisons are of a
Narcotic Quality, as Poppy and Henbane—being taken in too
great a Quantity, become poisonous. I shall only add some Instances
of Persons kill’d by eating poisonous Plants, Roots, and
Herbs. The Wife of <i>W. Matthews</i>, near <i>Salop</i>, who having
gathered a Quantity of <i>Dog-Mercury</i>, which she took to be
another Herb, boiled it for their Supper, which very sensibly affected
the whole Family. One of the Children slept from
<i>Thursday</i> Night till <i>Monday</i> Evening, then just opened her Eyes,
and died immediately. The other two Children slept about 24
Hours, and, upon their awakening, fell a vomiting and purging,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>which, ’tis thought, saved their Lives<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c019'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. A certain Woman near
<i>Kilkenny</i> in <i>Ireland</i>, eating by mistake, a <i>Hemlock-Root</i> among
<i>Parsnips</i>, was immediately seized with a Raving and Madness.

<p class='c013'>Eight young Lads went a fishing to a Brook near <i>Clonmel</i>
in <i>Ireland</i>, and there meeting with a great Parcel of <i>Oenanthe
Aquatica succo viroso</i>, they mistook the Roots of it for <i>Sium
Aquaticum</i> Roots, and did eat heartily of them. About four or
five hours after coming home, the eldest of them, on a sudden,
fell down backwards, and lay kicking and sprawling on the
Ground, foaming at the Mouth; soon after, four more were
seized the same way, and they all died before Morning: not one
of them having spoken a Word from the Moment in which the
venenate Particles surprised the <i>Genus nervosum</i><a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c019'><sup>[35]</sup></a>. Of the other
three, one ran stark-mad, but recovered; another had his Hair
and Nails fallen off; the third alone escaped: perhaps it might
be owing to a strong Constitution, and eating less of that fatal
Root; or perhaps it might be attributed to his speedy running
above two Miles home (after he saw one young Man fall) together
with his drinking a very large Draught of warm Milk from the
Cow, in his midway, and a violent Sweating, which might expel
many of those venemous Particles. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>An Experiment has been made upon a Dog, by giving him
the <i>Nux Vomica</i>, which soon poisoned him. The <i>American
Physick Nut</i> is said to be so poisonous, that no Animals make a
near Approach to it. Wormwood in <i>Persia</i> is so venemous, that
if Horses, or any other Creatures, eat thereof, they die immediately;
upon which account, say the Duke of <i>Holstein</i>’s Ambassadors,
we durst not unbit that day<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c019'><sup>[36]</sup></a>. The <i>Indians</i> have what
they call <i>Juico Juice</i> among them, which deprives such as drink
of it of their Reason, and renders them perfect Idiots; tho’ at
the same time it leaves them in the perfect Enjoyment of their
Health and natural Powers.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><i>CHARCOALS</i> prepared from <i>Vegetables</i>, have a poisonous
Quality; for, when kindled, they exhale a Vapour, which, if it
be kept up, and confin’d to a close Place, proves fatal. ’Tis said,
Charcoal made in <i>Cornwal</i> affords a manifest arsenical and sulphurous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Smell beyond others; and yet Charcoal is a <i>commodious</i>
Fuel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even when the sharp Points of Nettles pierce the Flesh, they
instil a kind of venemous Juice into the Wound, which gives
a painful Sensation. The Leaf of a Nettle has some relation to a
Sting; ’tis covered with very sharp Prickles, whose Base, which
is a Bladder of a flexible Substance, has a Hole in the middle, by
which this venemous Liquor runs into the wounded Part, and
excites Pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>This may be easily perceived with a Microscope; if a Man
press with the Finger, the End of those Prickles against its
<i>Base</i>: for then, thro’ these Prickles which are transparent, this Liquor
is manifestly seen to mount, and to descend, as the ingenious
Mr. <i>Hook</i> assures us, he had often made the Experiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Carmania Deserta</i>, towards the <i>Persian</i> Gulph, they have
two sorts of dangerous Shrubs, one called <i>Gulbad-Samour</i>, i. e.
the Flower that poisons the Wind, where there are many of these
<i>Shrubs</i>. The Wind that passes thro’ them, kills those who are
near it. The other is <i>Kerzehre</i>, the <i>Gall</i> of <i>Asses</i>, because it kills
those Creatures, and others that eat of it; yea, the Water that falls
from it is poisonous. They say, that Part of its Root which
spreads to the East is Poison: for which, that on the South-side
is an Antidote<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c019'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.——<i>N. B.</i> Is not our Author mistaken?
for can any Poison grow in the delicious Plains of the East, consecrated

<p class='c013'>An Overdose of Opium, which is the condensed Juice of Poppies,
is poisonous. The <i>Turks</i> take <i>Opium</i>, which they call <i>Affion</i>,
without any Preparation, it being merely the Juice of black
Poppy, dried in the Sun, without any purification. It is wonderful,

<p class='c013'>The Vapour arising from vegetable Liquors during their Fermentation,

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“I think, says a learned Physician, that God made no Poison,
but all things in the World were made for the Use of Man;
their chiefest <i>Deleterium</i> is either in the Quantity, or some
other Circumstance, as in Lettice, Leeks,—whose <i>Integra</i> are
Aliments, the Juices mortiferous. Those things that are pernicious,
by their external Form, as beaten Glass, Sponges, have
not deserved the Brand of Poison; those that are really lethiferous,
are but the Excrescences of Sin, and came in with the
Thorns. The Serpent was rather destructive to the Soul than
the Body.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the Ancients was a Plant that killed Mice with its
bare smell, according to <i>Pliny</i>: The Poets feign it to have sprung
from the Foam of the Dog <i>Cerberus</i>, when <i>Hercules</i> dragg’d him
out of Hell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Aconite Plants</i> also are extremely caustic and acrimonious,
in virtue whereof they have produced terrible Inflammations,
that end in Mortification. So great was the People’s Dread
of this Plant, for its venemous Quality, that they durst not touch
it and yet, ’tis said, they made use of it against the Sting of
<i>Scorpions</i>, which is supposed to be deadned by the Touch of the
Aconite, and restored to its Vigour by that of <i>Hellebore</i>.</p>

<p class='c032'><i>N. B.</i> The Root of the Plant is said to cure all Diseases proceeding
from Melancholy, as Disaffections from the <i>Hypochondria</i>,
<i>Herpes</i> or cutaneous Inflammations.</p>
<p class='c034'>It is also reported that Arrows dipped in the Juice of <i>Aconite
Plants</i>, proved mortal wherever they wounded.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. <i>The Globe we inhabit, abounds with Variety of Minerals,
of a very mischievous Nature</i>; as <i>Arsenic</i>, found in Copper-mines;
<i>Orpiment</i>, a Mineral found among Copper-mines, in Stones of
different Bigness, Colour and Figure. These, and others of the
same venemous Nature, are less or more dangerous, according as
their Salts receive a different Force from the metallic Particles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Mineral Kingdom is very subject to Damps, or noxious
Streams, and often found in Mines, Pits,——and in Kinds various.
There are also Exhalations, a sort of Fumes issuing from Body,
and diffusing themselves in the Atmosphere. Some make difference
between Vapours and Exhalations: The Term <i>Vapour</i>, they
say, is appropriated to the moist Fumes raised from Water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>Exhalation</i>, to the dry ones emitted from solid Bodies, as Earth,
Fire, Minerals, Sulphur.
The nocuous Effluvia sent forth from them may infect the
Air, and cause epidemical Distempers, and even new Diseases.
About Mines and deep Caverns, are frequently found copious Exhalations
continually streaming out, which, in a Moment, destroy
any Animal that comes within their reach; so much as the very
Insects themselves not escaping: Therefore these Places were by
the Ancients called <i>Gehennæ</i>, <i>Averni</i>,—intimating thereby, that
a <i>Mineral Pit</i> was <i>Hell</i>, and that <i>Subterraneous Exhalations</i> were
<i>Steams</i> from the <i>Fiery Lake</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>STRABO</i> takes notice of a <i>Cave</i> or <i>Grotto</i> in <i>Natolia</i>, from
whence issue pestilential Vapours that infect the Air: No sooner
is any Animal put in, but it immediately dies. Bulls have been
put in, and suddenly taken out dead. Sparrows that have been
thrown in, dropt down dead instantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Turks</i> fancy it to be haunted by evil Spirits, because those
who had the Curiosity to enter it, have either <i>died</i> or fallen desperately
<i>sick</i><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c019'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Mineral Poisons are more or less dangerous, as their Salts
receive a greater or less Force from the metallic Particles: And
hence, as the most virulent may be mitigated by breaking the
Points of the saline Crystals, the most innocent Minerals may
become corrosive, by combining them with Salts, as is seen in the
Preparations of Silver, Antimony, Iron.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing more fatal than mineral Poison, which often
brings swift Destruction without remedy. To a large Dog,
says the learned Dr. <i>Mead</i>, was given a Drachm of <i>Mercury Sublimate</i>,
mixt with a little Bread, who after violent Evacuations,
died next Morning. The same Gentleman observes, that in <i>Arsenic</i>
is a very noxious quality: the factitious white is the most
violent of all kinds, superior in force to <i>Mercury sublimate</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>These mortiferous Steams that flow from the Earth, are
called <i>Mephites</i>, <i>poisonous Damps</i>; and are very common in Countries
fruitful of Minerals and Mines: <i>Damps</i> happen in most of
the <i>Hungarian-Mines</i>, not only in the direct Passages, where they
walk on horizontally, but also in the perpendicular Descents.
Now, to guard themselves against the fatal Effects of these Exhalations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>they sometimes clear their way by Fire and the Bellows,
but generally by long Tubes or Pipes, reaching from top to bottom,
thro’ which they let the Air in and out; and by this Circulation
of the Air, they carry on their Work for some time
without Danger.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>CREMNITS</i> in <i>Hungary</i> (a small Town, reckon’d the
chief of the Berg, or Mine-Towns) is famous for its Gold-Mine
which has been work’d on 900 Years, where the Workmen sometimes
are troubled with pernicious Damps, and many are kill’d
by them; and so it happens in the Mines at <i>Schemnits</i>, the fairest
of the seven Mine-Towns<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c019'><sup>[41]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the Minerals known to us, there are many more
noxious than wholesome and the Power of the former to do mischief,
is more efficacious than the Power of the latter to do good;
which is evident from the little Benefit the Miner’s Health receives
from any mineral Effluvia, compar’d with the great and
sudden Damps, that are often caused by the Expirations of <i>Orpiment</i>,
<i>Sandarac</i>, and <i>white Arsenic</i>, which is a deadly Poison,
and most fatal of the whole Tribe of Fossils. Hence the Refiners

<p class='c013'><i>MERCURY</i> is extremely volatile, being convertible into
Fumes, even by a Sand-heat. Those who practise the Art of
Gilding, are but too well acquainted with these mercurial Fumes,
which frequently render them epileptic and paralytic, and sometimes
throw them into a Salivation. This kind of Poison is found
in <i>Friuli</i>, a Province in <i>Italy</i>, belonging to the Emperor, and also
in <i>Spain</i>, <i>Hungary</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The miserable People condemn’d, or hired to work in these
Mines, all die in a little time: they are so affected with those venemous
Fumes, that from Tremors they proceed to salivate, then
their Teeth drop.—One of them who had been there six Years,
was so full of <i>Mercury</i>, that holding a Piece of <i>Gold</i> in his Mouth
a little while, it became of a <i>Silver Colour</i>, and when taken out, it
was found heavier than before, <i>ibid.</i> p. 74.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>COPPER</i> is another poisonous Mineral, difficult of Fusion, and
when fused, if a single Drop of Water do but fall upon it; or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Vessel it be cast in, be ever so little moist, it flies into innumerable

<p class='c013'>Such are the <i>mephitical</i> Exhalations in a little Cavern in <i>Italy</i>,
call’d <i>Bacca Venosa</i>, the poisonous Mouth, not far from <i>Naples</i>,
but more generally known by <i>Grotto de Cani</i>, the <i>Dog’s Cave</i>;
because the Experiment of its poisonous Nature is frequently made
upon Dogs; tho’ it be fatal as to any other Creatures that come
within the Reach of its venemous Fumes. This wonderful Cave
is (situated at the Bottom of a Hill) in Dimension, about eight
Foot high, twelve long, and six broad.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the Ground within it, arises <i>a thin warm Fume</i> (visible
to the Eye) which is one continued Steam covering the
whole Surface of the Bottom of the Cave; it does not disperse
itself into the Air like Smoke, but quickly after its Rise, falls
back again into the Earth. The Fumes rise about a Foot high
and never higher, and hurt no Creature whose Head is above that
height; but when a little Dog, or the Head of any other Creature
is forcibly held in the Steam, it falls down dead, the
Limbs convuls’d, and trembling; and if left there a little while,
it dies, but if taken out soon, and laid in the open Air, comes to
Life again, and sooner, if thrown into the adjacent Lake.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>CHARLES</i> the Great, King of <i>France</i>, and Emperor of
the <i>West</i> (a Title of Honour other <i>Gallick Monarchs</i> have had in full
view for some time) made the Experiment upon an <i>Ass</i>, whose
Head was held in the Fume, and was soon destroy’d. <i>Two Slaves</i>
put in with their Heads kept down to the Earth, were both soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>kill’d. To this, I shall add some Experiments made by the ingenious
Mr. <i>Addison</i>, who says——</p>

<p class='c032'>—“A Dog that has his Nose held in the Vapour (within the
Cave) loses all the Signs of Life in a very little time.” Then
he observes, how long a Dog was expiring the first time, and after
his Recovery, and found no sensible Difference. “A <i>Viper</i>
put in, adds he, bore it nine Minutes the first time we put it
in, and ten the second. When we brought it out after the first
Trial, it took such a vast quantity of Air into its Lungs, that
it swell’d almost twice as big as before, and it was perhaps, on
this Stock of Air, that it lived a Minute longer.</p>

<p class='c035'>“A Torch, Snuff and all, goes out in a moment, when dipt into
the Vapours or Steams of that Cave——A Pistol can’t fire in
it. I split a Reed, and laid in the Channel of it a Train of
Gun-powder, so that one end of the Reed was above the Vapour,
and the other at the bottom of it; and I found, tho’ the
Steam was strong enough to hinder a Pistol from taking fire in
it—that it could not intercept the Train of Fire, when it once
begun flashing, nor prevent it from running to the very end—fire
will live in it no longer than in Water, because it wraps itself
in the same manner about the Flame, and by its Continuity
hinders any quantity of Air, or Nitre from coming to its
succour<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c019'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c033'>III. We come now to the sensible Region, where animal Poisons
reign; that is, Poison drawn from Animals, as the Viper, Asp,
Scorpion, Lepus Marinus: and here we are to encounter with an
Army of Serpents, and their formidable Train.</p>

<p class='c013'>When we speak of the Poison of Serpents, we must not suppose
it diffused thro’ the whole Body, as some have imagined.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Many Errors about the particular Situation of it, have been happily
removed by the Learned Dr. <i>Redi</i>, and Dr. <i>Mead</i>, who observes
the Viper has always been so notorious for its Poison, that
the most remote Antiquity, made it an Emblem of what is hurtful
and destructive, but were not agreed from whence the Poison
proceeded, whether from the <i>Saliva</i>, the <i>Teeth</i>, the <i>Gall</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
which leads me to a Passage in the <i>noble Italian</i>, who says:</p>

<p class='c013'>... That as a certain Learned Society in <i>Italy</i> were debating
this Point, one <i>Jacobus Sozzi</i> (<i>audiendi gratiâ</i>) who was allow’d to
be present, stationed himself in a corner of the Place, and hearing
some of them affirm that the Poison was in the Gall-bladder,
fell a smiling; and being ask’d the Reason, he answer’d, that
the Serpent’s <i>Gall</i> was an innocent Part: Whereupon, in their
Presence, he drank a Glass of Wine, mixt with the <i>Gall of a
Viper</i>, without any ill Effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the Company said, he came thither with his Body
prepared by Alexipharmicks. He, to convince them of the contrary,
try’d the Experiment upon Dogs, and other Animals, by
giving them the <i>Gall</i> of Vipers to drink in abundance, without
any Danger ensuing<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c019'><sup>[46]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In the Debate about the Seat of the Poison, the famous <i>Italian</i>
maintains, that all the <i>Venom</i> of a Serpent consists in a <i>yellow
Liquor</i> contain’d in a Bladder, at the bottom of its Tooth, which
Liquor, upon its biting, by the Pressure of the Bladder, is forced
thro’ a Tube within the Tooth, into the Wound, and thence ensue
direful Effects. This Hypothesis he supports by a good number
of Experiments upon various Animals, which were bit by a
Viper, after those venemous Bags were taken out, without any
Signs of Poison, or any ill Consequence at all<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c019'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another <i>celebrated Physician</i> maintains, that this <i>yellow
Liquid</i> is not poisonous, that he had given it to Pigeons as Food,
without their being at all disorder’d thereby.—That the Viper’s
Bite, he had always found mortal to Animals, even after the venemous
Bag was taken out, as well as before.—That therefore
the Poison must lie in the <i>irritated Spirits of the Viper</i>, which it
exhales in the Ardor of its biting, and which are so cold that
they curdle the Blood, and stop the Circulation<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c019'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

however, give into the Sentiments of <i>Seignior Redi</i>, as answering

<p class='c013'>Seignior <i>Vigani</i> has in some measure reconciled these two
Learned Combatants, who alledges, that the <i>yellow Liquor</i> wherewith
Dr. <i>Redi</i> kill’d Pullets, <i>&amp;c.</i> after the death of the Viper,
was either saturated with the Spirits of the enraged Viper, by
whipping it before, or else (as ’tis probable) in the hot and dry
Climates of <i>Italy</i>, those Creatures are more venemous than in
colder Countries.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Poison of Vipers seems to lie in their hollow Teeth,
because the Mountebanks of old, to impose on the People, used
to stop those Cavities, or hollow Places in the Teeth, with some
kind of <i>Paste</i>, before they suffered the Vipers to bite them in sight
of Spectators; which was commonly done, and succeeded according
to their wish;—and sometimes, with a Needle scratch’d
the Gums, and press’d out the Poison<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c019'><sup>[49]</sup></a>. <i>Pliny</i> says, they have

<p class='c013'>But to come nearer home, and to a cheap and easy Antidote
against the serpentine and canine Venom, by a certain Experiment
lately made in <i>England</i>, which was thus, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>... One <i>William Oliver</i>, and his Wife from <i>Bath</i>, who follow
the Business of catching and selling Vipers, offer’d themselves—to
be bit by any Viper, that should be procured, trusting to the
Virtue of a certain Remedy they had found out by chance in trying
things, when the Woman was once accidentally bitten.——The
usual known Medicine, even the <i>Oil of Vipers</i>, having no
Effect in assuaging her Pains, they had recourse to the <i>common
Oil of Olives</i>, which proved an effectual Remedy. The Circumstances
of the Case were——</p>

<p class='c013'>On the first of <i>June 1735,</i>  in the Presence of a great number
of Persons, the said <i>William Oliver</i> was bit by an old black
Viper, or Adder, (brought by one of the Company) upon the
Wrist, and Joint of the Thumb of the Right-Hand, so that Drops
of Blood came out of the Wounds: He immediately felt a violent
Pain, both at the top of his Thumb, and up his Arm, even before
the Viper was loosen’d from his Hand: Soon after he felt a
Pain resembling that of Burning, trickle up his Arm; in a few
Minutes, his Eyes began to look red and fiery, and to water
much.</p>

<p class='c013'>In less than half an Hour, he perceived the Venom seize his
Heart, with a prickling Pain, which was attended with Faintness,
Shortness of Breath, cold Sweats: In a few Minutes after this,
his Belly began to swell, with great Gripings, and Pains in his
Back, which were attended with violent Vomitings, and Purgings.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the Violence of these Symptoms, his Sight was
gone for several Minutes; but he could hear all the while: He
said, that in his former Experiments, he had never defer’d making
use of his Remedy longer than he perceived the Effects of the Venom
reaching his Heart; but this time, being willing to satisfy
the Company throughly, and trusting to the <i>speedy Effects of the
Oil</i>, which had never fail’d him, he forbore to apply any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>till he found himself exceeding ill, and quite giddy. About an
Hour and Quarter after the first of his being bit, a Chafing-dish
of glowing Charcoals was brought in, and his naked Arm was
held over it as near as he could bear it, while his Wife rubb’d in
with her Hand the <i>Sallad Oil</i>, turning his Arm continually round,
as if she wou’d have roasted it over the Coals.</p>

<p class='c013'>He said the Pain soon abated, but the Swelling did not diminish
much; most violent Purgings and Vomitings soon ensued, and his
Pulse became so low and so often interrupted, that it was thought
proper to order him a Repetition of Cordial Potions. He said he
was not sensible of any great Relief from these, but that a Glass
or two of <i>Olive Oil</i> drank down seemed to give him ease: Continuing
in this dangerous Condition, he was put to Bed, where
his Arm was again bath’d over a Pan of Charcoal, and rubb’d
with <i>Sallad Oil</i> heated in a Ladle over the Charcoal, by Dr.
<i>Mortimer</i>’s Direction.——Whereupon he declared he found immediate
Ease, as tho’ by some Charm——then fell into a profound
Sleep, and after about nine Hours found Rest, awak’d, about six
the next Morning, and found himself very well; but in the
Afternoon, on Drinking some Rum and strong Beer, so as to be
almost fuddled, the Swelling return’d with much Pain and cold
Sweats; which abated soon on bathing the Arm as before, and
wrapping it up in a brown Paper soaked in the Oil.</p>

<p class='c013'>The learned Dr. <i>Mortimer</i>, relates the Success of this simple
Medicine, tried afterwards on other Animals, who were purposely
bitten, both by the same, and by fresh Vipers, to experience
the Efficacy of it<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c019'><sup>[53]</sup></a>.</p>

Pepper</i>. It was first published by Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i>, in <i>Numb. 237</i>
of <i>the Transactions</i>, A. D. 1720, under the Name of <i>Pulvis Antilyssus</i>;
where the Manner of giving it, not only to Men, but to
Dogs and Cattle, is accurately set down. The Doctor says, the
<i>Lichen Cinereus Terrestris</i> is accounted exceedingly efficacious in
curing Dogs bitten by mad Dogs; then adds, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>That King <i>James</i>, when Duke of <i>York</i>, caused this <i>Lichen

Poison; they rub the Venom of Snakes with their own Spittle, between
two Stones and having mixed them well, they scratch
upon the Wings of the Stomach, and to the Part so scratch’d,
which is bloody, they apply a small Part of the Mixture; the rest
they take inwardly.——This never fails to expel the Poison in the
Wound, or in any other Part affected with it: In about a Month’s
time a perfect Cure is made; in order to which, when they
judge the Poison is expell’d, they cleanse the Wound, and apply
to it the leaves of <i>Buchu</i>, <i>Dacha</i>, and other <i>salutiferous</i> Herbs:
But they say, the least Neglect of such a Wound, (be it by a poisonous
Arrow, or any other way) is dangerous<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c019'><sup>[55]</sup></a>.</p>

the <i>East-Indians</i>, who, with the Powder of it taken in Water or
Wine, cure many Distempers, and among others, the Stings of
Serpents, which abound in that Country.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Naturalists say, the Virtue of it was first discovered
by a small Creature, like our Ferrets, which when stung by Serpents,
runs and eats of the Snake-wood, and is cur’d.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father <i>Regnault</i>, speaking of Poisons, mentions several
Methods of Cure, as Incisions, Ligatures, Caustics, Vomits, Oil
of Olive, Baths, Treacle, Juice of Citron.</p>

<p class='c013'>By a Ligature, which hinders the Poison from spreading.</p>

<p class='c013'>By Caustics, or red-hot Iron brought within a certain Distance
of the Wound; because Heat attenuates the Poison by its
action, and dissipates it.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Effect of Poison has some Analogy with that which
happens upon syringing (thro’ Curiosity) some acid Liquor into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the Veins of a living Dog, or other Creature; for in a short time
he falls into Convulsions, and dies. A Decoction of <i>white Hellebore</i>
injected into the jugular Vein of a Dog, as soon as it enter’d
the Heart, kill’d as suddenly as if shot thro’ the Heart with a
Bullet. On <i>January 4, 1679</i>, a Drachm and a half of <i>Spirit of Salt</i>,
diluted in an Ounce and half of Water, and injected into the jugular
Vein of a Dog, kill’d him immediately. We kill’d a Dog
almost in a Moment by injecting into his jugular Vein an Ounce
of <i>Spirit of Wine</i>, in which was dissolved a <i>Drachm of Camphire</i>:
The same Day we injected warm into the crural Vein of a Cat,
50 Grains of <i>Opium</i>, dissolved in an Ounce of Water, which was
soon seized with convulsive Motions, and died within a Quarter

<p class='c031'>All venemous Creatures hurt, by instilling a liquid Poison
into the Wound, suppose the Wound to be given by the Tooth or

no more than one good Drop that does the Execution</i>.”——In order,
adds he, to examine the Texture of the Liquor, I enrag’d a

whose Parts I view’d with a Microscope as nicely as I could.</p>

swallow’d without mortal Effects, say some of the Learned. Hence
it is, wounded Persons have been directed to get the Venom immediately
suck’d out, which has been practis’d without ill Consequences
to the Sucker.</p>

<p class='c013'>For this Method of curing venemous Wounds by Suction,
<i>Avicenna</i>, an old <i>Arabian</i> Philosopher and physician, is quoted;
who says, that those who suck out the Poison are in no danger,
so their Teeth be sound and perfect, and their Mouths be free
from all Ulcers. At <i>Rome</i> was an Order of Servants whose Office
was to suck venemous Wounds, which they did with Safety and

<p class='c032'>“Many <i>acid Substances</i> taken into the Stomach, are, by its

<p class='c031'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Creatures reputed venemous, are indeed no Poisons when
swallowed, tho’ the Venom may prove so when put into Wounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Venom that falls upon the Skin, is not so mischievous
as that which enters into the Stomach, or is communicated by
a Wound. “Yea, the Venom of a Viper, in itself, is not mortal
to a robust and strong Body; and tho’ very unhappy and
mischievous Accidents attend it, as Convulsions, Vomitings,

hurt by them. It is said, these <i>Psyllians</i> inchanted Serpents, who
fled at the sight of them, as if their Bodies exhaled some <i>corpuscular
Effluviums</i> that were most offensive to Serpents, and put
them into such pain that made them run. To these, the General
added another Set of Persons, famous for curing the wounded
by other Methods; and all little enough, Serpents being the Lords

<p class='c013'>Add to this, the Example of Queen <i>Cleopatra</i>, who, to prevent
her being carried to <i>Rome</i> in Triumph, ’tis said, poisoned
herself, by holding a Serpent to her own Breast. <i>Galen</i> mentioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>this Story, relates from Authors, that she killed herself, by
pouring the Poison of an Asp into a Wound made in her Arm
by her own Teeth; as if under Conviction, that the Poison would
not effectually answer the End, without touching the Blood. <i>Ibid.</i>

<p class='c033'>III. <i>In Serpents is an inexhaustible Store of Poison.</i> If they discharge
all their Artillery to-day, their Arsenal will be full to-morrow.
’Tis true, by a speedy repeated Emission of Poison at
one time, the Viper loses its force, probably by a Diminution in
Quantity; but is recruited in a Short space. Thus, one Viper
cannot poison six Creatures, one immediately after another; the
Truth of which is confirmed by uncontestable Facts.——An
Experiment was made by Dr. <i>Areskine</i>, when he was at <i>Paris</i>.—Having
got a large female Viper, he made it bite six Pigeons, one
immediately after another. The first and second that were bit,
died within half an Hour; one a little before the other; the third
lived about two Hours; the fourth seem’d to be very sick for a
while, but recover’d; the fifth and sixth that were bitten, were
no more hurt than if prick’d with a Pin. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The learned <i>Italian</i>, Seignior <i>Redi</i>, says, that having, at the
Entrance of Winter, a Scorpion sent him to <i>Rome</i> from <i>Tunis</i> in
<i>Africa</i>, he irritated it to sting Pigeons and Pullets, without any
bad Effects; but upon the approach of warm Weather, after eight
Months fasting it was provoked to sting two Pigeons successively,
which soon died; but the third and fourth received no hurt from
its Wound.
The Author of the <i>Natural History of Carolina</i>, speaking of
the <i>Rattle-Snakes</i>, says, they can’t renew their Poison as oft
as they will; for he had seen a Person bit by one of them, who
never rightly recovered, and very hardly escaped with Life; and
another Person immediately after being bit by the same Snake, received
no more Hurt than if bit by a Rat. <i>p.</i> 129.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c019'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c032'><i>N. B.</i> Poison in different Countries, is more or less dangerous
according as it is exalted and heighten’d by various Degrees
of Heat; for by Increase of Heat, that venemous Quality is
increased.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>How is it consistent with Divine Goodness to create such venemous
Animals, that are so dangerous and destructive to their Fellow-Creatures?</i>
I answer,</p>
<p class='c033'>I. <i>That as the Power of God shines in the Formation of all
Creatures, so does his Goodness in their natural Perfections, which is
the Goodness of their Being.</i> Every Creature is good, and if any
Branch of the Creation be hurtful to another, ’tis the Effect of moral
Evil, and not any necessary Consequence arising from their Creation.</p>

<p class='c013'>This noxious Quality in Serpents, is God’s Creature, and must
answer some valuable Purpose, tho’ concealed from an Eye blinded
by the Venom of Sin. Nor must we forget that they seldom hurt
their Fellow-Creatures, but when they are provok’d; and when
they hurt, they present us with a healing Remedy, that is, <i>the
volatile Salt of Vipers, which if rubbed into the Wound, has been
generally applied with Success</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. <i>Their poisonous Liquid must some way be beneficial to
themselves.</i> We are not told what their original Food was; but
now they live by Plunder, and by their Venom they are enabled
to make sure of their Prey, which otherwise might escape, or
grow too strong for them, and so they might starve for want of
proper Means to support Life; and what they take by their venemous
Fangs and Stings, is good Nourishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Poison also, is to them as a Life-Guard. Were there
not something terrible in their Weapons of War, every one
would trample upon them. Add to this, that perhaps their Constitution
may be so modify’d and framed, that this venemous Liquid
may be as useful to digest their Food, as our <i>Saliva</i> is to us
in that respect.</p>
<p class='c033'>III. <i>SERPENTS, tho’ venemous, are of special Use to
Mankind, as they are Part of the</i> Materia Medica, <i>and bear a
great Share in some of the best Antidotes, or Remedies against Poison</i>.
Vipers make a considerable Article in Medicine; their Flesh either
roasted or boiled, the Physicians unanimously prescribe as an
excellent Restorative, particularly in Consumptions, Leprosy.——</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The learned Dr. <i>Mead</i> recommends the Broth or Jelly of Vipers;
or, as the Antients did, to boil and eat them as a Fish, or
at least to drink Wine, wherein they have been long infused: The
Apothecaries sell the <i>Pulvis Viperinus</i>, which is only <i>dried Vipers
pulverized</i>, Heart, Liver, and all other Parts, and past through
a fine Sieve. Some call it, <i>Animal Bezoard</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>BEZOAR</i> is a <i>Persian</i> Word, <i>Pazahar</i>, primarily denotes
<i>Counter-Poison</i>, and is applied to several chymical Compositions of
that Intention. <i>Theriaca</i>, or Treacle, a Name given by the Antients
to various Compositions, is reckoned good against Poison.—The
Basis or Foundation of the Composition is Viper’s Flesh<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c019'><sup>[64]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is supposed, when Viper-Catchers were hurt, they immediately
cured themselves by rubbing this <i>volatile Salt</i> of Vipers
into the wounded Part. An Experiment was made by enraging
a Viper to bite the Nose of a young Dog: The Part began to
swell; to which was applied this <i>volatile Salt</i>, and the Dog was
very well next day. The Viper was made to bite the Dog again
in the Tongue, and no Application being made, he died within
a few Hours<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c019'><sup>[66]</sup></a>.</p>

by this means they were quickly healed</i>. The same Author adds
from <i>Porphyrius</i>, that the great <i>Greek</i> Physician <i>Craterus, very
happily cured a miserable Slave, whose Skin in a strange manner fell
off from his Bones</i>, by advising him to <i>feed upon Vipers, drest after
the manner of Fish</i>. Ibid.</p>

<p class='c013'>A late eminent Physician, speaking of Vipers, says,——’Tis
certain, very noble Medicines are prepared from them, and
a Wine from their Flesh, singular in consumptive, leprous, and

<p class='c013'>In <i>Italy</i> is a subterraneous Cavern, called <i>Grotto de i Serpi</i>,
large enough to hold two Persons, perforated like a Sieve; out of
which, in the Spring, issues a numerous Brood of young Snakes,
of divers Colours. In this Cave they expose their leprous, paralytic,
arthritick Patients, where the Warmth of the Steams resolving
them into Sweat, and then Serpents clinging variously all
around, licking their naked Bodies, they are soon restored to
Health, by repeating the Operation. This <i>Serpentine Cave</i> was
visited by <i>Kircher</i>, the celebrated Philosopher and Mathematician;
who says, he saw the Holes, and heard a murmuring hissing
Noise in them, tho’ he did not see the Serpents, it not being their
Season to creep out; yet he saw a great Number of their <i>Exuviæ</i>,
or <i>Sloughs</i>, and an Elm at a small distance laden with them.
The Discovery was by the Cure of a Leper going from <i>Rome</i>, who
losing his way, and being benighted, happen’d upon this Cave,
and finding it very warm, pull’d off his Clothes; and being weary
and sleepy, had, says my Author, the Good-fortune not to feel
the Serpents about him, till they had wrought his Cure. <i>Musæum

<p class='c013'>Spontaneous Productions of the Earth were the first Food,

time before they came to the Juices of Cattle, as Milk, and longer
before they commenced carnivorous, and devoured their Fellow-Animals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some think the Fruits of the Earth were intended as Man’s
sole Food, and that nothing but Necessity or Luxury first prompted
to feed upon Flesh: And indeed, by the Structure of Man’s
Teeth, it looks as if they were not proper to devour Flesh; and
that Nature had rather intended and prepared them for cutting
Herbs, Roots,——than, for tearing of Flesh. Yea, Children don’t
affect Animal Food, till their Palates be vitiated by Custom; and,
further, when we feed upon Flesh, it must be prepared by roasting

<p class='c013'>When the Church of <i>Israel</i> murmured against God in the
Wilderness, and censured the Conduct of Providence, he employs
an Army of Serpents as his Agents, to correct the Rebels.——Plagues,
and other pestilential Diseases, were, in old times, reputed
to be the Messengers of the Gods, and commissioned by them, to
execute Wrath upon the Wicked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the Heathens had exalted Notions of Virtue, and
believed Men of Virtue to be the Favourites of the Gods, and
that a vicious Life, being opposite to the Sanctity of their Nature,
they could not let it pass with Impunity.</p>

<p class='c013'>An Instance to this purpose we have in the History of the
Apostles, <i>Acts</i> xxviii. 1-6. The <i>Island</i> was called <i>Melita</i>.
<i>And when Paul had gathered a Bundle of Sticks, and laid
them on the Fire, there came a Viper out of the Heat, and fastened on
his Hand. And when the Barbarians saw the venemous Beast hang
on his Hand; they said among themselves, No doubt this Man is a
Murderer, tho’ he has escaped the Sea, yet Vengeance</i> (δικη, <i>Justice</i>)
<i>suffers not to live——They looked when he should have swoln, or faln</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>down—And when they saw no harm come to him, they changed
their Mind, and said he was a God.</i> <i>How</i> came they to alter their
Opinion? Because, according to their Divinity, none else could
thus command, and controul a venemous Serpent, which was one
of the <i>Messengers of the Gods</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No venemous Beasts, according to the fabulous Tradition, will
live in the Island, which they ascribe to St. <i>Paul</i>’s Blessing, when
he was shipwreck’d there.” They shew the Cave where they
pretend he resided, and reckon the Earth of it, an Antidote against
Poison.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this historical Passage, ’tis evident, that these Barbarians
did believe a <i>Providence</i>, and the Doctrine of <i>Divine Justice</i>,
which <i>Justice</i> they openly adored, under the Name of <i>Vindicta</i>, or
<i>Nemesis</i>, which was the <i>Goddess</i> of <i>Revenge</i>, whose Province was to
inspect the moral Conduct of all Men, and distribute Rewards and
Punishments as the Case required. It was painted in the same

<i>Tartarus</i>, the Place of Torment,—and all those who had lived
well, were conducted to the <i>Elysian</i> Fields.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>HOMER</i> speaks of them as the Executioners of Justice upon
false Swearers, among other Instances:</p>

<p class='c031'>The <i>Harpies</i><a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c019'><sup>[97]</sup></a> were monstrous and cruel Birds describ’d with
Women’s Faces, and <i>Dragons Tails</i>, to render them more formidable
to Mankind: The Ancients looked upon them as Dæmons
or Genii, which last <i>Homer</i> calls <i>Podarge</i>. About <i>Kaskan</i> in
<i>Persia</i>, is a fine and fertile Country, but plagued with Multitudes
of <i>Scorpions</i>, which haunt the Inhabitants, especially in that
Town (one of the most populous and eminent Marts in that Empire)
where the Inhabitants, for fear of that venemous Animal,
dare not sleep upon the Floor (as in other Places, where they only
throw a Quilt upon the Tapestry) but have light Couches,
hanging down from the Roof, like Seamens Hammocks, or hanging
Beds on ship-board.</p>

<p class='c013'>They have indeed a ready Help against its venemous Wounds,
which is made of the Filings of Copper, tempered with <i>Vinegar</i>
and <i>Honey</i>, which proves a speedy Cure; but if neglected, the
Patient is in danger of his Life. This, says the Historian,
I presume, has been first found out by the antipathetick Quality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>which seems to be between <i>Scorpions</i> and <i>Copper</i>; for not far
from the City is the Copper-Mine, where, as before, if one of
these Animals be brought, it dies immediately. <i>Q. Whether this

<p class='c013'>Yea, to render a future State terrible to Mortals, the Heathens,
speaking of departed Souls, feigned, that at their Descent from
<i>Charon</i>’s Boat (who was the Ferryman of Hell) they met <i>Cerberus</i>,
a monstrous Dog, with three Heads, who was covered all
over with <i>Serpents</i>, instead of Hair. There was the Monster
<i>Chimæra</i> that vomited Fire, her Head like a <i>Lion</i>, Middle like a
<i>Goat</i>, and her Tail like a furious <i>Dragon</i>; so sings the Poet:</p>

of Serpents to salute their Entrance into Hell, there was
Variety of Punishments for them when there. Thus the <i>Danaides</i>
were condemned to <i>Tartarus</i> by the Poets, to be continually employed
in filling a Cask perforated at the bottom; <i>Phlegas</i>, condemned
by <i>Apollo</i> to Hell, where he sat upon a rolling Stone, in
constant danger of falling into a Pit of greater Misery; <i>Tityus</i>,
adjudged to Hell, where a Vultur feeds on his Liver, and the
Liver always grows with the Moon: Nay, such were the horrible
Preparations in Hell, that <i>Virgil</i><a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c019'><sup>[98]</sup></a>, after a Survey of it, declares,
that had he a hundred Mouths and Tongues, they would not suffice

most frightful.</p>

</div>
<p class='c040'><i>Which gives a View of most Serpents that are known
in the several Parts of the World, describ’d by their
various Names, different Countries, Qualities</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<hr class='c030' />

<p class='c013'>The Serpents are a numerous Tribe, and their Dominions
of large Extent, lying both in Sea and Land: No part
of the World but what is replenish’d with them, more
or less, in some form or other. In describing them, I shall begin
with,</p>
<p class='c033'>I. The <i>Viper</i>, or <i>Adder</i>, a subtle and poisonous Creature,
slender in Body, about a Foot and half long, with fiery and flaming
Eyes, a long and cloven Tongue, which when irritated, it
darts forth with Violence, and looks like a glowing Firebrand;
has a big Head, and flattest of the serpentine kind.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>It is slow in its motion, and does not leap like other Serpents,
but is very nimble to bite when provok’d. The Scales under
the Body resemble that of well-polish’d Steel. They appear
in divers Colours, yellow, ash, green; and others of <i>Libya</i>, like
the Inhabitants, of a blackish Hue; its Front not unlike that of
a Hog.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>VIPERS</i> of other Nations, are supposed to be larger than
the <i>European</i>, especially the <i>Troglodite-Viper</i><a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c019'><sup>[99]</sup></a>, which is said to
be above fifteen Cubits long: and the Historian adds, viz. <i>That
there are no domestick Vipers</i>. I presume, he means they are not
brought up among the Children of the Family, as some Serpents
are said to have been; this little venemous Reptile being of a
more mischievous Nature<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c019'><sup>[100]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Viper</i> differs from the <i>Snake</i> in bulk, being not so large,
and their Scales more sharp, and Head more large: They also
differ in this, <i>viz.</i> Snakes lay their Eggs, twenty, thirty, sixty,
and a hundred sometimes, in one Nest, not quite so large as that
of a Magpye (which are inclosed with a whitish Skin, but not
with Scales) in Dunghills and other warm Situations, where they
are hatch’d by adventitious Heat, commonly call’d Adders in this
Country; whereas Vipers make use of their own Matrix, and
bring forth live Vipers: Their young ones come forth wrapt up
in thin Skins, which break on the third day, and set the little
venemous Creatures at liberty, therefore rank’d among the viviparous
Animals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Births are much like young Snigs for Bulk; they generally
bring forth about twenty young ones, but only one each
day. It is observ’d of the Viper, that its Internals are not fetid,
like those of some other Serpents, that are intolerable.
The Eggs of <i>Lizard-Serpents</i>, which are so much esteem’d
in the <i>French-Islands</i> of <i>America</i>, are of the same Size and Figure
as those of Pigeons, and are generally used in all sorts of Sauces:
When the Females lay their Eggs, they make a Hole in the Sand,
and cover them with it, and the Heat of the Sun is sufficient to
hatch them<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c019'><sup>[101]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>ALBERTUS</i> is quoted for a Battle between a Viper and a
Magpye, occasioned by her creeping up into a Magpye’s Nest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and devouring her Brood in the Mother’s absence, who upon
her Return made a hideous clattering, which soon brought in its
Mate; whereupon both, with united Beaks, fell upon the Plunderer,
and after a sharp Engagement demolish’d the Enemy.</p>

<p class='c032'>Father <i>Fevillee</i> in the Woods of the Island <i>Martinique</i>,
“being frighted by a large Serpent, which he could not well
avoid, his Dog immediately fell on, and took the Serpent
by the Head: The Serpent surrounded him and press’d him
so violently, that the Blood came out of his Mouth; and
yet the Dog never ceased till he had entirely tore it to pieces.
The Dog was not sensible of his Wounds during the Fight,
but soon after, his Head prick’d by the Serpent swell’d prodigiously,
and he lay on the ground as dead; but his Master having
found hard by a <i>Bananier</i>, which is a very watry Tree, he
cured him with the Juice of it, and some Treacle<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c019'><sup>[102]</sup></a>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c031'>The <i>Viper</i> is common in some parts of <i>France</i>, especially
in <i>Dauphiny</i> and in <i>Poictou</i>, from whence all
the Vipers come that are
sold in <i>Paris</i>. They are usually taken with wooden Tongs, or
by the end of the Tail, which may be done without danger; for
while held in that Position, they can’t wind themselves up to hurt
their Enemy. The Viper-Catchers have their Specificks, in which
they can safely confide, as not to be afraid of being bitten; which
they say is <i>the Fat of a Viper</i>, immediately rubb’d into the Wound,
which is one of the most venemous in the animal World.</p>

<p class='c013'>These Vipers are usually put and kept in a Box with Bran
or Moss; not that these Ingredients serve to feed upon, as some
may fancy; because ’tis said, <i>they never eat after they are taken</i>
and confin’d, but live on the Air, and will live so, many Months:
But more hereafter. <i>The Destruction</i> of Vipers by human Spittle,
the Coition of the Marine with Lampreys, the pregnant Viper
biting off her Companion’s Head, and the Revenge of it by the
Younglings——I place among vulgar Errors.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. The <i>Amodytes</i> is a Serpent very venemous and fierce, of a
sandy Colour, black Spots, and of about a Cubit long. The Wound
given by the Female, the weaker Vessel, is said to be most dangerous:
Its Jaws are larger than the common Vipers, and from
some Eminencies upon the Head, like a Tuft of Flesh, is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><i>Cornutus</i>. Its Wounds prove fatal without a speedy Cure. It is
found in <i>Lybia</i>, a Limb of <i>Africa</i>, and also in <i>Illyricum</i>, and in
some parts of <i>Italy</i><a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c019'><sup>[103]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Serpent is called <i>Cornutus</i>, a horned Beast<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c019'><sup>[104]</sup></a>. Of this

<p class='c013'>Upon the Continent of <i>America</i> are Bulls and Cows, that
have no Horns, says Dr. <i>Ch. Leigh</i>——who adds,</p>
<p class='c032'>“The Defect
of <i>Horns</i> in these Beasts, brings into my mind a remarkable
Phenomenon of one <i>Alice Green</i>, whose Picture I have seen in
<i>Whalley-Abby</i>, in <i>Lancashire</i>. This Woman had <i>two Horns</i>
which grew out of the back-part of her Head; they grew
backwards like those of Rams, and were about three Inches
long; these she cast once in three Years, and had always intolerable
Pains, before the Horns broke out<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c019'><sup>[105]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c031'>He might have mentioned another innocent Creature, on
whose Head a treacherous Companion inoculates a Scion, which
intitles him to the Title of Cuckold, a word derived from <i>Cuckows</i>,
who having no Beds of their own, invade their Neighbour’s. Of
the <i>Cuckow</i> ’tis said, that having no Nest, she takes possession of
some other Bird’s Nest, destroys the Eggs, and lays in it an Egg
of her own, which the innocent Bird brings forth and nurses for
its own<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c019'><sup>[106]</sup></a>.</p>

Cuckow to be true upon his own Knowledge, according to Mr. <i>Ray</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c033'>III. The <i>Cerastes</i> is a Serpent of the viperine Kind; its Head
resembles the <i>Cornigerous</i>; it belongs to the <i>Libyan</i> and <i>Nubian</i>
Family: Its Teeth are like those of the Viper, and it brings its
Successors into the World after the same manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its Constitution is very dry, which refines and exalts its Poison,
and makes it more dangerous; the Wound is generally attended
with Distraction, and continual pricking as with Needles.
Some say, ’tis of a whitish Colour, others arenaceous; it loves
sandy Habitations, where it often surprises the unwary Traveller:
And all agree ’tis of a most cruel Nature; and therefore in some
Places ’twas made the Executioner of Malefactors<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c019'><sup>[107]</sup></a>, as the Juice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of the <i>Cicuta</i>, (an Herb like our <i>Hemlock</i>) was among the <i>Athenians</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some say ’tis of the aspick kind, as the <i>Arabians</i>; in length a
Cubit or more, with two Horns on the Head, resembling Snail-Shells:
It lies perdue near travelling Paths, and is very crafty in
decoying little Birds into the Snare.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its Wounds soon kill, if one of the <i>Psyllian</i> People be not immediately
called in. <i>N. B.</i> These <i>Psylli</i> are a noted People of
<i>Syrenaica</i> in <i>Africa</i>, endued with a natural Faculty of destroying
Serpents upon sight, and curing their Wounds by a Touch of the
Hand of whom we have this Account, <i>viz.</i> ... <i>Crates</i> of <i>Pergamus</i>
says, that about <i>Parium</i> in the <i>Hellespont</i>, there were Men,
named <i>Ophiogenes</i>, who cured those wounded by Serpents with a
Touch. <i>Varro</i> testifies there were some of them in his time.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>AGATHERCIDES</i> writes, that in <i>Africa</i> the <i>Psyllians</i>
(a People so called from King <i>Psyllus</i>, from whom they were descended,
and whose Sepulchre is to be seen at this day in the greater
<i>Syrtes</i>) did in the same manner heal People wounded by Serpents.
’Tis said they had some extraordinary Quality in their Nature, that
would suddenly kill all Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by these they tried the Chastity of their Wives, thus,
<i>viz.</i> When a Child was born, and its Legitimacy questionable,
they laid it in a <i>great Vessel</i> full of these <i>cerastick Serpents</i>, that
immediately breathed Destruction; but when they came near the
Child, their Rage soften’d, and they immediately fled from it;
which proved the Legitimacy of the Child, that he was a true
<i>Psyllian</i>, born in lawful Wedlock, because Serpents could not
poison it, nor endure its Presence<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c019'><sup>[108]</sup></a>.</p>

Child was begotten by a Stranger, ’twas killed by Poison; if lawfully
begotten, the Privilege of his Father’s Blood protected him against
the Venom.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>However this romantic Account may appear, it may doubtless
be philosophically accounted for by Effluviums emitted from
their Bodies, that proved fatal to Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>English</i> Annotator upon <i>Lucan</i>, who was Nephew to
<i>Seneca</i>, observes much to the same purpose, when he says, These
<i>Psylli</i> (a People inhabiting those parts of <i>Africa</i> called <i>Marmarica</i>,
bordering on the <i>Nile</i>) are fortify’d by Nature with an incredible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Privilege against the Strength of Poison, and sustain no Harm by
the biting of Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpents, says <i>Pliny</i>, are afraid of them, and when others
are bitten by them, these <i>Psyllians</i> by sucking the Wounds, cure
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Marsians</i> in <i>Italy</i>, ’tis said, are still in possession of this
natural Power against Serpents, and are supposed to descend from
the Son of <i>Circe</i>, the famous Enchantress.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Trial of Childrens Legitimacy by Serpents, puts me in
mind of Hereditary Right; whose Title was try’d by the <i>Fatal-Stone</i>,
on which the <i>Irish Monarchs</i> used to be inaugurated on the
Hill of <i>Tarah</i>; and which being inclosed in a <i>Wooden-Chair</i>, was
made to emit a Sound under the rightful Candidate, when he sat
in it; but was quite silent under one who had no Title, or not a
good one; that is, one who was not for the Druidick Priest’s
Turn.</p>

<p class='c032'>“This Stone was sent to confirm the <i>Irish</i> Colony in <i>Scotland</i>,
where it continued to be the Coronation-Chair till in the Year
1300, <i>Edward</i> I. of <i>England</i> brought it from <i>Scoon</i>, and placed
it under the Coronation-Chair at <i>Westminster</i><a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c019'><sup>[109]</sup></a>; and there it
still remains, is used in the Coronation, the antientest respected

<p class='c013'>Such natural Power against <i>Diseases</i> did in our Days appear
in the celebrated Mr. <i>Greatrix</i>, before <i>whose Hand they fled</i>. In
the Philosophical Transactions we have the following Account
of it, received from Eye-Witnesses,—<i>e. g.</i></p>

<p class='c032'>“... My own Brother, <i>John D——n</i>, was seized with a violent
Pain in his Head and Back: Mr. <i>Greatrix</i> (coming by accident
to our House) gave present Ease to his Head, by only
stroaking it with his Hands. He then rubb’d his Back, which
he most complain’d of, and the Pain immediately fled from
his Hand to his right Thigh; then he pursued it with his
Hand to his Knee, from thence to his Leg, Ancle and Foot;
and at last to his great Toe. As it fell lower, it grew more

<p class='c013'>These Serpents are <i>Asiaticks</i>, Inhabitants of the Rocks in
<i>Syria</i>; <i>Syria</i>, the supposed western <i>Porch</i> of <i>Paradise</i>. These
resemble the <i>Hemorrhous</i> in Colour and external Figure: According
to <i>Ælian</i>, they change into the Similitude of the Things they
light upon. He might, I think, as well have said, they chang’d
their <i>Notes</i> on different Trees, since there is a kind of relation
between <i>Musick</i> and <i>Colour</i>, as the Learned <i>Newton</i> observes.</p>
<p class='c033'>VI. <i>KOKOB</i> Serpent, is between three and four Foot long,
of a dusky Colour, and made beautiful by Spots of red and light
Blue. Its Wounds are terrible, and the Effects not very dissimilar
to those of the <i>Hemorrhous</i>. <i>Nierembergius</i> observes, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>resides among Stones; and when it rambles out, and hears any
Noise, makes towards it like a mighty Hero. Thus the <i>Gallic</i>
Monarch, upon Debates among Princes, marches out as sovereign
Umpire of <i>Europe</i>, and never returns home but by way of <i>Lorrain</i>,

<p class='c033'>VII. The <i>Asp</i>, so called from the <i>Asperity</i> of its Skin, as <i>Arnoldus</i>,
or from <i>aspiciendo</i>, because of the Acuteness of its Eyes.
A Serpent well known, but not accurately describ’d, says the
Learned Mr. <i>Ray</i>: Some make it a small Serpent, others say ’tis
several Feet long; and both may judge right, for according to
<i>Ælian</i>, there are various Species of Asps; some a Foot and half
long, and others six.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among these different Proportions, the least of them is said
to be most hurtful, and kills the soonest. Its Poison is so dangerous
and quick in its Operation, that it kills almost in the very
Instant that it bites, without a Possibility of applying any Remedy:
They die within three Hours, says my learned Author<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c019'><sup>[117]</sup></a>;
and the manner of their dying by Sleep and Lethargy, without

<p class='c013'>When provok’d, the Neck of this Creature swells, and the
Wound then given, is most dangerous. Its Teeth are of considerable
length, growing out of the Mouth like the Tusks of a
Boar. The Historian says, that two of the longest Teeth have
little Cavities in them, covered with a thin Skin, that slides up
when it bites, by which means the poisonous Liquid runs out,
and drops into the Puncture; after which, it recovers its Station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Banks of <i>Nilus</i> abound with <i>Asps</i>, who have Sagacity
enough to remove their Habitations to a place of Safety, several
days before that River overflows the Rising-Grounds about it:
’Tis also said the <i>Crocodile</i> and <i>Tortoise</i> recede with their Eggs, to
a Situation not accessible by that mighty Flood; a Flood that
makes the Land of <i>Egypt</i>, a Region of Fertility, a Flood dreaded
by these Animals, and ador’d by the <i>Egyptians</i>, those Sons of
Contradiction, who consecrated their Animals to the Gods, and
then worshipped them, and upon Occasions kill’d them. (Can
we behold such Instincts in the <i>Crocodile</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> without acknowledging
the Divine Wisdom that ordain’d ’em!) No Nation more
knowing, and more sottish, <i>e. g.</i> Upon the Statue of <i>Minerva</i>,
or the Goddess <i>Isis</i>, was this Inscription, <i>viz.</i> <i>I was she that was,
that am, and shall be, and that am every thing</i>. Which being an
exact Interpretation of the Word <i>Jehovah</i>, and the same Definition
the Almighty appropriates to himself, I can’t, says the Learned
<i>Jurieu</i>, conceive, how a Nation that was arrived to such a high
Degree of Knowledge, should have worship’d <i>Bullocks—as Gods</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>PLUTARCH</i> gives a strange relation of them, <i>viz.</i> that in case
of any extraordinary Calamity, as War, Plague, Famine, the <i>Egyptian</i>
Priests used to threaten the <i>sacred Beasts</i> most horribly: If
they failed to help them, they whipt them till the Blood follow’d;
and if the Calamity did still continue, they kill’d those sacred
Beasts by way of Punishment<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c019'><sup>[121]</sup></a>. The Reverse of this is given us
in a <i>Clan</i> of <i>Tartars</i>, who, when exposed to any imminent Calamity,
sacrifice their Priests, in order to intercede for them with
the Gods in the other World.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been said, that the <i>Asp</i>, when exasperated, did, with
an erected Head, cast out of its Mouth liquid Poison; but it
now appears, it darts it only by its Bite, or by Poison taken
from it by Force, and poured into a Wound made by another;
and both the Wounds so made, soon terminate in an <i>easy pleasant
Exit</i>; which is supposed to be the reason why Queen <i>Cleopatra</i>
chose this kind of Death, that is, to poison herself by an
Aspick Dose. This reminds me of a certain Herb I have read of,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>in <i>Arabia</i>, which (according to the Tradition) <i>if a Man slept
upon</i>, he died in his Sleep without any Pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain learned Pen, makes this Remark upon <i>Cleopatra</i>’s
Case, <i>viz.</i> that she was not bit by an <i>Asp</i>, as some have
asserted, but did that which was more secret and sure; that is,
after she had bit her own Arm, infused Poison into the Wound,
expressed before-hand from an <i>Asp</i> by Irritation, and preserved in
a Phial for that purpose: Or, as <i>Dio</i> says, she wounded her Arm
with a Needle, or Dressing-pin, and then poured the Poison into
the bleeding Wound. This seems probable, because no Serpent
was found in her Chamber or near it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Queen</i>, in order to find the most easy Passage out of this
Life, made an Experiment upon Criminals by various kinds of
Poison, and Application of diverse sorts of Serpents, and found
nothing came up to <i>Aspick Poison</i>, which throws Persons into a
pleasant Sleep, in which they die<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c019'><sup>[122]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The common Tradition is, that when Men by Inchantments
and Charms have attempted to take these Serpents, they stopt
one Ear with the Tail, and the other was either deaf, or made so
by laying it close to the Ground. Some are of Opinion, that
there is a sort of <i>Asp</i> that really is deaf, which of all others is the
most dangerous, and is meant by the <i>Royal Prophet</i> here.</p>

<p class='c013'>That there was a Practice of charming Serpents by some Art
or other, so that they could neither <i>bite</i> nor <i>sting</i>, seems evident
from the sacred Writings, <i>e. g.</i> Eccl. x. 11. <i>Surely the Serpent
will bite without Inchantment.</i> Jer. viii. 17. <i>I’ll send Serpents,
Cockatrices, among you, that will not be charmed, and they shall
bite you, says the Lord.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Among other Things the word <i>Charmer</i>, some say, signifies
<i>one</i> that conjoins and consociates; that is, that by Sorcery
gather’d Serpents together, and made them tame and familiar;
or the <i>Person</i> may be so call’d, because by <i>Magick Art</i>, he associated
with <i>Demons</i>, the Lords of Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are inform’d by History, of some, who have summoned
together a hundred Serpents at once; but by what method, I
leave the Reader to judge. <i>Montanus</i>, a famous Physician, and
Professor at <i>Padua</i> in <i>Italy</i>, says he saw this Coadunation of
Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The learned Doctor <i>Casaubon</i> tells us, he had seen a Man,
who from the Country around him, wou’d draw Serpents into
the Fire, which was inclos’d in a magical Circle: When one of
them, bigger than the rest, would not be brought in, upon repeating
the aforesaid Charms, it submitted to the Flames.</p>

<p class='c013'>We read of a famous Charmer at <i>Saltsburgh</i> in the Circle of
<i>Bavaria</i>; that, when (in sight of the People) he had charm’d a
great Number of Serpents into a Ditch, where he kill’d them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>there came a Serpent of great Bulk, supposed to be the Devil, that

does understand the <i>Greek</i> Idiom, <i>Osy, Osya, Osy</i>; that they
should, at the first Sound of these Words, <i>stop their Ears</i>, remain
immoveable, and do us no hurt with their Poison? From whence
he infers, there was a Power in Words to operate upon the Ear,
without Superstition. The Antients seem to have entertain’d
some favourable Thoughts of the <i>Power of Spells</i> upon Serpents:
Their Poets speak often of these Charms and Incantations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some affirm that <i>Magick</i> consists in the <i>Spirit of Faith</i>, for

them, and by which Spirits they do wonderful Things, that to
vulgar Eyes appear like Miracles. No doubt but several extraordinary
Effects have been ascrib’d to the Devil, that in reality
were natural, and artfully disguised: The Story of Sieur <i>Brioche</i>,
a famous Puppet-player, is well known, who in a Town in <i>Switzerland</i>,
where that <i>Show</i> had never been seen before, he was apprehended
as a Warlock or Magician, and ran the hazard of being

<p class='c013'>Others affirm, that <i>Charms by Words</i> are but means to
heighten the Imagination; and the strange Effects produced by
’em, flow’d only from the Activity of an exalted Thought, or
Fancy of heated Brains. In proof of this ’tis said, that if a Woman
at a certain Season, strongly fix her Imagination upon any
particular Object, the Child will bear the Image thereof.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think ’tis pretty obvious, that those extraordinary Impressions
made by <i>Pagan Sophists</i> upon the Minds of their Audience
by the Charms of Rhetorick, past for a <i>divine Afflatus</i> or
<i>Inspiration</i>; and therefore in such Cases, we shall find this <i>Formula</i>
(<i>Aliquis nescio quis Deus</i>) frequently used by Enthusiastical
<i>Orators</i>, as well as their <i>Poets</i>: Thus <i>Cicero</i>, speaks of himself, that
he was mov’d by a certain <i>Impetus</i> or Ardour<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c019'><sup>[130]</sup></a>: <i>Apollonius Tyanæus</i>,

<p class='c013'>’Tis true, that wonderful Things have been done by Words,
but how <i>verbal Charms</i> operated upon <i>Serpents</i>, wants Explication:
Of some Inchanters ’tis said, that by vocal and instrumental
Sounds, they have charm’d Rats, Mice and Serpents, some into
a stupid State, and others into a flexible submissive State.</p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable Instance in <i>Rats</i> we have in the publick Records
of <i>Hamelen</i>, (an antient City on the River <i>Weser</i> in <i>Germany</i>,
about 28 Miles S. E. of <i>Hanover</i>) where the following strange
Account is register’d, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>That in <i>June 26. 1284</i>, a certain Stranger undertook to
destroy an Army of Rats with which the Town had been long
pester’d, on promise of such a Reward; and immediately playing
on his <i>Pipe</i> and <i>Tabret</i>, the <i>Rats</i> march’d out, and follow’d the
Musick to the River, where they were all drown’d: But being
denied the Reward, he threaten’d Revenge; and next day he
went about with the same Musick, and most Children in the
Town follow’d the Piper to the Mouth of a great Cave on a
neighbouring Hill call’d <i>Koppelberg</i>, where he and they entered,
and were never heard of after.</p>

<p class='c013'>In remembrance of this <i>sad Catastrophe</i>, the Citizens for many
Years after, dated all their publick Writings <i>from the Day they
lost their Children</i>, as appears by their old Deeds and Records:
They still call the <i>Street</i> thro’ which the Children went out,
<i>Tabret-street</i>; and at the Mouth of the Cave there is a Monument
of Stone, with a <i>Latin</i> Inscription, giving the Particulars of this
tragical Story.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the other Instance, <i>viz.</i> Serpents charm’d into a ductile
manageable State, ’tis thus accounted for; <i>viz.</i> Serpents, they
say, are strangely influenced by the Smell of those Emanations,
proceeding from the <i>Cornus</i>, or Dog-tree (why not the <i>Cornelian-Cherry</i>,
antiently dedicated to <i>Apollo</i>?) and that by a Wand or
Rod taken from it, they are thrown into an obsequious Temper—</p>
<p class='c032'>“When
touch’d by a Rod from that Tree, they are immediately
intoxicated, but so as to be able to follow the Motion of the
Rod; but whether by reason of some great Disproportion or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Incompossibility, between these subtile Effluvia and the Temperament
of the vital, spiritual Substance of the Serpent, or by
what other way, we are not told<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c019'><sup>[131]</sup></a>. The Sassafras-tree, a Native
of <i>America</i>, is call’d <i>Cornus</i> also, whose Wood is very odorous
and fragrant.”</p>
<p class='c034'>Now, say these Gentlemen why should
it seem impossible, that he who understands this invincible Enmity,
and how to manage a Rod of the <i>Cornus</i> with Cunning and
Dexterity (having first intoxicated a Serpent by the Touch thereof)
should during that Fit make it observe, and readily conform
to all the various Motions of the Wand, so as that the unlearned
Spectators, perceiving the <i>Serpent</i> to approach the <i>Inchanter</i>, as
he moves the Wand near to himself, or to retreat from him, as
he put the Wand from him, or turn round and dance as the Rod
is mov’d to and fro, or lie still as in a Trance, as the Rod is held
still over it; and all this Time, the People knowing nothing of
the Virtue in the Rod, are easily deluded into a Belief, that the
whole Scene is supernatural, and the main Energy radiated in
those Words or Charms, which the Impostor with great Ceremony
and Gravity of Aspect mutters forth, the better to disguise
his Legerdemain, and dissemble Nature in the colour of a Miracle.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is allowed indeed, that there are <i>dumb Creatures</i> that do exceed
Man in some <i>sensible Perceptions</i>, particularly in that of <i>Smelling</i>,
as the <i>Harriers</i>, and other Dogs. How strange, that
Odours from the Hare’s Body, Should so affect the Nose of a
Hound, as to raise in him that Sensation or Scent, by which he
follows her all the Day (tho’ he never had a Sight of her) thro’ a
Cloud of Opposition, from perplexing intricate Places, and Effluviums
proceeding from other Animals!</p>

<p class='c013'>These Emanations are exceeding fine Effluvia, or Particles
flying off odorous Bodies in all Directions; and as they float in the
Air on the Surface of the Earth (within their Atmosphere) strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>against the Dog’s Nose, and produce that Sensation of Smell.—<i>N.
B.</i> The Intensity of Smell in all Creatures, is in proportion to
the Density or Thickness where we are: This Density is always
diminish’d in proportion to the Squares of the Distances from the
odorous Body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yea, a little Cur, by the Power of Smelling, can find out his
Master among Thousands, will trace his Steps thro’ Crouds in Fairs
and Markets; yea, throughout a whole Country. Our Histories
inform us of Dogs in some parts of this Island, that being put upon
the Scent, would pursue a Thief and a Murderer; and if he
cross’d a River, would smell where he entered, and swim after
him; and when arrived at t’other side, would hunt about till
they found where he landed, and then run on, till they overtook
the Criminal.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Animals is a sulphurous or oily Matter, so attenuated and
subtiliz’d as to become volatile, which is denominated a Spirit:
Now that there is such a Spirit in Man, and a peculiar one too in
every Man, is evident from these Dogs, which will pursue the
Game by their Nose, and follow their Master’s Track, and distinguish
it precisely; yea, tho’ a thousand other Persons had past
the same way.</p>

<p class='c013'>It must be by meer Force of Smelling, that the Dog is able
to do this, that is, to distinguish his Master from all Men by the
Instrumentality of his Nose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Therefore there must be some specifick Matter exhaled
from the Master’s Body, which the Dog can perfectly distinguish
from the various Effluvia flowing from all other Persons.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Dog must exceed us, in that he can thus exactly discern
his Master, by these subtile, oily, or sulphurous Effluvia, which
no human Nose was ever able to do.</p>

<p class='c013'>We find the like Spirit in the Hound, who when put in the
Track which a Deer has lately been in, will follow the Steps of
that Deer thro’ all cross Paths of a thousand others, and at last
single out that individual Deer among a whole Herd of those Animals.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Scotland</i> are a sort of Dogs (in Colour generally red and spotted
with black, or black with red) of extraordinary Sagacity, being,
as ’tis said, put upon the Scent, will pursue Thieves with Success;
and the Use of them has been authorised by the Magistrate——<i>Nullus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>perturbet aut impediat canem trasantem, aut homines transentes
cum ipso ad sequendum latrones aut ad capiendum malefactores</i>.</p>
<p class='c032'><i>N. B.</i> <i>Trasantem</i> is a Word latiniz’d from the old <i>French</i>
<i>Tracer</i> or <i>Trasser</i>, signifying to follow by the Track.</p>

<p class='c031'>If any shou’d suggest, That this derogates from the Wisdom
and Goodness of the Creator, who has given to some Beasts
stronger Perceptions, Nerves more exquisitely fine and delicate
than he has bestow’d upon Man:</p>

<p class='c013'>I answer, this is so far from derogating from divine Wisdom
and Goodness, that it is an admirable Instance and Illustration
of both; for were our olfactory Nerves susceptible of such
quick Sensations as Dogs and some other Animals, we shou’d be
continually annoy’d with pestiferous Fumes and Exhalations, so
as not only to render most Situations troublesome, but even Life
it self miserable and wretched.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such quick Sensations may be very useful to carnivorous Animals,
so as to direct them to their Prey, but to human Beings it
wou’d be very vexatious, if not pestiferous and deadly. I shall
only add to this Digression, a short Hint about the <i>Magic Art</i>,
the most surprising of all Arts, and in its first Appearance most
innocent and useful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the antient <i>Chaldeans</i>, <i>Babylonians</i>, and <i>Persians</i>,
where the Art-magic was first and principally cultivated, it signified
no more than <i>Wisdom</i> and hence the <i>Sophi</i>, or Wisemen
of the <i>Greeks</i> were by them call’d μαγοι that is, <i>Magicians</i>; who
being acquainted with many of the hidden Powers of Nature, directed
them in such manner, as to produce Effects, whose Causes
being unknown to the <i>Vulgar</i>, were attributed to <i>Dæmons</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hence the Art in process of Time came into Disrepute, and
Magicians have been censur’d, as working by Compact with the
Devil: But this is invidious; for in the Gospel we find, the <i>Magi</i>
or <i>Magicians</i>, are said to come <i>from the East to</i> Jerusalem, <i>saying,
where is he that is born King of the</i> Jews? <i>for we—are come to worship
him</i>. No body can imagine this to be understood of those that
have been called <i>Sorcerers</i>, <i>Wizards</i>, <i>Conjurers</i>, <i>Witches</i> or <i>Magicians</i>,
in the modern Sense of that Word<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c019'><sup>[133]</sup></a>; for those who were
familiar with the Devil, would scarce come to enquire after him,
who came to destroy his Works.</p>

Charms, while their rival Beauties, the Sun and Stars

<p class='c013'>We read of a certain King of <i>Egypt</i>, who having assembled
his <i>Magical Priests</i> without the City <i>Memphis</i>, caus’d them to enter
where the People were gather’d, by Beat of Drum: All of
them made some miraculous Discovery of their Magic and Wisdom.
<i>One</i> had his Face surrounded with a Light, like that of
the Sun, so bright that none could look earnestly upon him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another seem’d as if enrob’d with precious Stones of diverse
Colours, red, green, yellow, or wrought with Gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>A third came mounted on a <i>Lion</i>, compass’d with <i>Serpents</i>,
like Girdles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next came in with a Pavilion, or Canopy of Light, distended
over his Head.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another entered surrounded with Flames of Fire, turning
about him; so that none durst come near him.</p>

<p class='c013'>After <i>him</i> appeared one with dreadful Birds, perching about
his Head, and shaking their Wings like Vulturs and black Eagles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>last</i> made his Appearance with an Army in the Air,
marching before him, of winged Serpents and terrible Personages.——In
fine, every one did what was taught him by the

<p class='c013'>In antient times, the Word <i>Magician</i> generally signified <i>Men

natural and divine, and more especially in that sort of Learning
relative to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, as we learn from <i>Porphyry</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span><i>Apuleius</i>, and others. And seeing the inspired Apostle gives them
that Name (<i>Magicians</i>) not as a Mark of Infamy, but a Title of
Honour, therefore does the <i>English</i> Translation stile them <i>Wisemen</i>,
such as the old <i>Greeks</i> called σοφοι, <i>Sages of their Time</i><a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c019'><sup>[135]</sup></a>.
How, and how far this Art is degenerated, I refer to the Judgment
of the Learned: We see there are Revolutions in Words, as well
as in Families and Kingdoms; a <i>Magician</i> being formerly a <i>Wise-man</i>,
as well as a Knave an honest one. <i>Sed tempora mutantur.</i></p>

unawares to cut an Asp with his Spade, and went mad upon
it,—was taken into the House of <i>Serapis</i>, an <i>Egyptian</i> Idol,—the
Relatives of the Patient praying the <i>Spectrum</i> of that Serpent
might be destroyed,——which being accordingly done by Magick
Art, the Man was cured.——By this we see, how highly <i>Asps</i>
were venerated among the <i>Egyptians</i>, who not only suffer’d them
to live, but to live in their Houses, where they were carefully fed,
as Favourites of the Family<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c019'><sup>[136]</sup></a>. And Queen <i>Cleopatra</i>’s Case was
not singular, for the <i>Persian</i> Kings kept an exquisite Poison by
them, made of the Dung of an <i>Indian</i> Bird, which would kill
without putting them to pain, that they might use it themselves
in case of any Disaster<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c019'><sup>[137]</sup></a>.</p>

borrowed from the <i>Greek</i> Word σκυταλη, a Staff, or any thing like

being in shape equally round, like a Rolling-Stone, with very
little Variation in the Extremities of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Serpent being adorned with beautiful Colours, excuse a
short Digression upon the Doctrine of Colours in Natural Bodies.
Know then, Colours are the Children of Fire and Light.</p>
<p class='c033'>I. <i>Where there is Light, there is Fire</i>; and Fire shews itself to
be present by Light. The Sensation of Light is produced when
the Particles of Fire, directed by the Action of the Sun, reach the
Eye in right Lines. Now, Fire thus entering the Eye, gives a
Motion to the optic Fibres at the bottom of the Eye, and thus
excites the Idea of Light.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. <i>FIRE discovers itself by Colour</i>; for all Colours depend
upon Light, and Light depends upon Fire; and different Colours
appear in Natural Bodies, as their Surfaces are disposed to reflect
this or that sort of coloured Rays more than others. Colour is
a Property inherent in Light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Colours therefore are not connate with Natural Bodies,
which are all of the same Hue in the dark. To this the Poet
alludes, when he makes <i>Darkness the Destruction of Colours</i><a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c019'><sup>[140]</sup></a>.—Colours
are only in the Rays of the Sun: In Natural Bodies is
a Quality or Power to reflect the Light falling upon them, which
striking the Eye, produces in the Spectator the Sensation of Colour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the Poets have thought this <i>Amphisbæna</i> to be the
<i>Hydra Lernæa</i>, the many-headed Serpent, that was very terrible
to the adjacent Country, and slain by <i>Hercules</i>: When one Head
was cut off, many others sprung up; so that there was no way to
destroy the Monster, but by cutting off all the Heads with one
Stroke.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tho’ there be no <i>Amphisbænick</i> Animals, there is some Resemblance
of it in Plants, whose <i>Cotyledon</i> is always double, and
in the common Centre of the two, is a Point or Speck, which is
the Plantule, or the Tree in Embryo; which Plantule being acted
on by the Earth, warmed by the Sun, begins to expand, and
shoots its Root both upward and downward. Thus, in a Bean
committed to the Ground, we soon see it to cleave into two
Parts, and in the Fissure appears a little Speck, which sends out a
Root downwards, and a Bud upwards.—A remarkable Phænomenon,
says the Note on <i>Boerhaave</i>’s Theory.</p>

<p class='c013'>X. Among Serpents, Authors place <i>Dragons</i>; Creatures terrible
and fierce in Aspect and Nature. They are divided into
<i>Apodes</i> and <i>Pedates</i>, some with Feet, and some without them;
some are privileged with Wings, and others are destitute of Wings
and Feet: Some are covered with sharp Scales, which make a
bright Appearance in some Position. Some have observed, that
about the <i>Ganges</i>, are Dragons whose Eyes sparkle like precious
Stones.</p>

<p class='c013'>They differ in external Form: The <i>Draconopades</i> are represented
by a human Face, and sightly Countenance; the rest of the
Body in a tortuous winding Shape. In one of Dr. <i>Johnson</i>’s Figures,
a Dragon is made to appear like a Man’s Face, with a Grenadier’s
Cap on the Head. Some differ in Colour, some are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>black in the upper Part of the Body, according to <i>Philostratus</i>;

<p class='c013'><i>GOZON</i>, who, after several dangerous Onsets escaped with

it was no where vulnerable but in the Eyes and Belly, contrived
the Resemblance of a Dragon by a Machine of Pastboard,
of equal Bulk with the Dragon, and by certain Springs made it
leap like a true Dragon: Having trained up a Couple of fierce
Dogs to attack it at the <i>Belly</i>, he went out privately one Morning,
well-armed on a managed Horse with his Dogs, and rode up to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Den, from whence the Dragon leaped furiously at him: In the
Encounter, the Dogs laid hold on his Belly, and forced him to lie
down; upon which the valiant Knight alighted, thrust his great
Sword several times into his Throat, and soon killed him: Upon
which the Spectators drew near, and with great difficulty sever’d
the Head from the Body, and lugged it into the Town in Triumph.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Conqueror was degraded for the sake of Form, because

<p class='c013'>In the Life of <i>Attilius Regulus</i> (the <i>Roman</i> General in the War

without effect, till the Military <i>Possé</i> was called in, who discharged

<p class='c013'>One <i>Œnomaus</i>, a certain Pagan Philosopher, highly resenting

<p class='c031'><i>F. BALTHUS</i>, a learned Jesuit, and <i>F. Bouchet</i>, say there were
real Oracles, and such that can never be attributed to Priests and
Priestesses; and that the Devil still gives Oracles in the <i>Indies</i>, and
that not by Idols, which would be liable to Imposture, but by the
Mouths of Priests, and By-Standers; and that the Devil becomes
mute, in proportion as the Gospel prevails.——</p>

<p class='c032'>“It is generally believed among the more Learned, that the Pagan
Oracles were mere Frauds and Impostures, and calculated
to serve the political Views of Princes, and covetous
Ends of Pagan Priests.”</p>

<p class='c031'>According to the learned <i>Bayle</i>,
they were meer human Artifices; and he is seconded by <i>Vandale</i>
and <i>Fontenelle</i>. But to return to the Oracle at <i>Delphos</i>, which
was very antient and much in vogue before the <i>Trojan</i> War: The
Situation of the Place, where People were made to believe God
spoke, was at the Mouth of a certain Cavern, whence they received
their Intelligence. The Prophetess sat upon a <i>Tripodium</i>, a three-footed
Stool, assisted in her Function by divers Priests.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under her Seat, ’tis said, that some time there appeared a
Dragon, through whose Throat Responses were audibly deliver’d,
with a loud and strong Voice: According to <i>Eusebius</i>, a Serpent
rolled itself about the Tripod, on which the Priest sat.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Of all Oracles, that of <i>Apollo Pythius</i> at <i>Delphos</i>, in the <i>Ægean</i>
Sea, was the most celebrated, and consulted as the <i>dernier Resort</i> by
the Princes of those Times; yea, all the <i>Greeks</i> resorted thither
for Counsel in Matters of Importance. At the first opening of
that <i>Oracular Office</i>, Answers were given to the Querist in Verse;
but upon People’s ridiculing the Poorness of the Verification,
the Oracle fell to Prose. ’Tis strange, that what they made a <i>God</i>,
could not make a <i>good Verse</i>, but not strange to see the old Serpent
adhering to its first Scheme of Politicks, by making the weaker
Vessel the Vehicle to convey his strong Delusions to the World.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of these Draconick Serpents excel in the Sensations of
Hearing and Seeing, as well as in the Art of Killing; and therefore
a <i>Dragon</i> was made the <i>Conservator</i> of their <i>Treasures</i> and <i>Curiosities</i>;
e. g. <i>Mauritania</i> in <i>Africa</i>, was famous for the Gardens of the
<i>Hesperides</i> (so called from three Sisters and Daughters of King
<i>Hesperius</i>) that produced <i>Golden Apples</i>, and were guarded by a
<i>Dragon</i>, which <i>Hercules</i> having killed or charm’d into a profound
Sleep, he robbed the Golden Orchard.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rod of <i>Moses</i>, ’tis said, <i>was turned into a Serpent</i>. The
<i>Syriack</i>, <i>Arabick</i>, and <i>Septuagint</i> Translations, say, twas turned into
a <i>Dragon</i>; and so the Rods of the Magicians became <i>Dragons</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XII. The <i>Basilisk</i> or <i>Cockatrice</i>, is a Serpent of the Draconick
Line, the Property of <i>Africa</i>, says <i>Ælian</i>, and denied by others:
In shape, resembles a Cock, the Tail excepted. Authors differ
about its Extraction; the <i>Egyptians</i> say, it springs from the Egg
of the Bird <i>Ibis</i>; and others, from the Eggs of a Cock: Other
Conjectures about its Descent, being as ridiculous, I forbear to
mention them. Nor are they agreed whether it more inclines to
the black or yellow Colour; nor are their Sentiments less various
about its Stature.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is gross in Body, of fiery Eyes, and sharp Head, on which
it wears a Crest, like a Cock’s Comb; and has the Honour to be
stiled <i>Regulus</i> by the <i>Latins</i>, the <i>Little King of Serpents</i>; and ’tis
generally supposed to be terrible to them. The Sight of this
Animal, and Sound of his Voice, puts them to flight, and even to
over-run their Prey<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c019'><sup>[157]</sup></a>: Yea, Tradition adds, that his Eyes and
Breath are killing; that is, I presume, when he grasps the Spoil.

the middle and posterior parts of the Body only touching the
Ground. The Venom of the Basilisk is said to be so exalted, that
if it bites a Staff, ’twill kill the Person that makes use of it; but

<p class='c013'>The reason why this Serpent is dubb’d <i>King</i>, is not because
’tis larger in bulk than others of the Fraternity, or because it wears
a Crown, or because that Title seems to be recognized by a divine
Prophet, who speaking of <i>Ahaz</i> and his Son <i>Hezekiah</i>, says,
<i>Out of the Serpent’s Root shall come forth a Cockatrice, and his
Fruit shall be a fiery flying Serpent</i>. The <i>Hebrew</i> expresses it by
a word, that Signifies a <i>Prince</i> or <i>King</i>, but not with a View to
Empire over the serpentine Race.</p>

<p class='c013'>But ’tis most probable, that the royal Stile is given to this
Serpent, because of its <i>majestic Pace</i>, which seems to be attended
with an Air of Grandeur and Authority. It does not, like other
Serpents, creep on the Earth; which if it did, the sight of it
would not be frightful, but moving about, in a sort of an erect
Posture, it looks like a Creature of another Species, therefore they
conclude ’tis an Enemy. Serpents are for Uniformity, therefore
can’t endure those that differ from them in the Mode of Motion.</p>

<p class='c013'>’Tis said of this Creature, that its Poison infects the Air to

<p class='c033'>XX. <i>Common Snake.</i> These Serpents in their Summer-rambles
haunt among Bushes, mossy Grounds, uliginous and unfrequented
Situations. In a sultry Day they may be seen basking themselves
in the Sun, near their Apartments: The Sight of a Person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>puts them to flight; and upon a close Pursuit of them, they
make a Stand, raise up their Heads to a considerable Height, and
oppose the Enemy with a loud and angry Hiss. No Danger is
apprehended from their Bite, and they are handled with Impunity.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Species of Serpents resembles the <i>Esculapian</i>, that has
been fed in some Families; and when provoked to use the Teeth,
the Danger is no more than that from a Bee, whose Weapons
are defensive, and not employed without Provocation: In Winter
they retire into subterraneous Spaces, where they lie dormant, till
the vernal Sun invites them out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though they propagate as Vipers, it does not appear that
they sit on their Eggs, as most oviparous Animals do; for we
often find a Brood of young Serpents in old Hedges and Dunghills,
and no visible Sign of a common Passage to and from the Nest.</p>
<p class='c033'>XXI. The <i>Elephantia Serpents</i> are those whose Wounds cast
People into a Leprosy or Roughness of Skin, like that of an Elephant:
Hence Leprosy proceeding from inward Disorders, is call’d
<i>Elephantia</i> or <i>Elephantiasis</i>, which is a cutaneous Disease, makes
the Skin scurfy and rough, in Colour resembling that of an Animal,
that in Bulk and Intelligence is superior to all four-footed
Beasts.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Elephants</i> in <i>India</i> are said to be about 12 Foot high,
and of a Mouse-colour, the Skin not only rough, but hard, so
hard, that it is not penetrable by a Sword; their Eyes like those
of Swine; two Teeth hang out beyond the rest, which are Ivory.</p>

<p class='c013'>A memorable Instance of this gigantick Creature’s Understanding,
we had a few Years ago at <i>Newcastle</i> in <i>Staffordshire</i>,
where a Man travelling with an <i>Elephant</i> for a Show, one Morning
conducting that Creature to water, happened to pass by a
Taylor’s Shop, that was working at an open Window, and so
near it, that the <i>Taylor</i> had the <i>Courage</i> to prick him with his
Needle: The Beast did not then seem to resent the Affront, but
when he returned from the Water, which he having artfully
muddled, took into his Trunk; as he came back by the Taylor’s
Window, spouted it in his Face, which very much disobliged a
Piece of Scarlet-cloth on his Table.</p>

<p class='c013'>That Elephants are subject to Wrath and Revenge, is evident
from other Instances: <i>e. g.</i> We read of an Elephant, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>when he was brought into a certain Theatre, saw, as he pass’d
along, a Keeper of wild Beasts, sitting in the Market-place, whom
he suddenly killed: And that the occasion of this Revenge was,
because the said Keeper about ten Years before had struck him
with a Sword in that same Place<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c019'><sup>[185]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>And <i>Acosta</i> writes, that a Soldier in the Town of <i>Cochine</i>,
had thrown the Kernel of a Nut at an Elephant, which the Animal
took up and carefully hid: Some Days after, the Elephant
seeing the said Soldier pass by, threw it in his Face, and went
away leaping and dancing. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>In that same Town, another Soldier, meeting an Elephant
and his Keeper, would not give way to them: Whereupon the
Keeper complained to the Elephant of the Affront, who some
days after, standing on the River <i>Mangata</i>, which runs through
the Town, and seeing that sturdy Soldier stand idle, ran hastily
towards him, lifted him upon his Trunk, and plunged him several
Times in the River; after which, he drew him out, and left
him where he found him. <i>Ibid.</i></p>
<p class='c033'>XXII. The <i>Scorpion</i> is one of the Inhabitants of the World in
Miniature; though a little Insect, yet is reckoned to be one of the
chiefest among stinging Animals, whose Poison in different Regions
is less or more dangerous, as it is exalted by various Degrees
of Heat. It has eight Legs, and two large Claws, resembling
those of a Lobster, and a Body like a Crab or Craw-fish: They
are of various Colours, as red, white, yellow, black: They differ
also in their Size and Kinds, as the marine, terrestrial, reptile,
winged, hurtful and innocent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some are of the Bigness and Length of a Man’s Finger, not
much longer than a <i>Beetle</i> or a black Fly: Those known to us
are of a brown Colour, the Back composed of Joints resembling
those of a Crab, but more crustaceous.</p>

<p class='c013'>Authors differ about the Tail, whether it be knotty or
not; but all agree, that it is furnished with a terrible Sting, worse
than the knotted Whip. Many Places produce <i>Scorpions</i> of the
minute Sort, not much exceeding the Length of a large Bean.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Others are more bulky, as those at <i>Jerusalem</i>, and all
about <i>Syria</i>, not unlike our little fluvial Crabs for Bigness, which
they call <i>Gambari</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>East-Indies</i> are large Scorpions of the winged Kind; so
in <i>Egypt</i>, where it is reported they are armed with two Stings<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c019'><sup>[186]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>It is observable, these large Scorpions taking their Flight
against the Wind, sometimes drop down, and so are taken by the
Country People, and perhaps sent to scorpionize other Kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Sea-scorpion</i> is a flying Animal, and of a red Colour,
whose Flesh is good, and much better than what they call <i>Scorpœna</i>,
that affects muddy Water and moorish Habitations.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a vast Spread of these venemous Animals over the
World, both of the winged and creeping Kind, in the Eastern
and Southern Climates. Some of them move with Tails somewhat
erected, others trailing on the ground; and are thought to
be more dangerous than the former: The Coal-black Scorpion is
accounted the most hurtful; ’tis said, that in many Places in <i>Persia</i>,
the Inhabitants dare not sleep in Ground-rooms, for fear of
these little plaguy Creatures, the most terrible of all Night-walkers:
Of which more elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain Historian informs us of stimulating Scorpions
that infest <i>Cashan</i> in <i>Parthia</i>: They are of small Size, not strong
in Body, but very terrible in their Wounds, there being the
greatest Malignity in their Stings; upon which is grafted this proverbial
Curse in that Nation, <i>May a Scorpion of</i> Cashan <i>sting
thee</i><a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c019'><sup>[187]</sup></a>: But <i>Chardin</i>, <i>Tavernier</i>, and others, place <i>Cashan</i> in <i>Persia</i>,</p>
<p class='c041'>“where they are very much infested with Scorpions at all
Seasons, but especially when the Sun is in that Sign, which is
one of the twelve Signs in the <i>Zodiack</i>; so that ’tis become,
says another Historian, a Curse, <i>May the Scorpions of</i> Cashan
<i>sting thy Gulls</i>.”</p>
<p class='c034'>This occasions every one to be provided with
<i>sovereign Remedies</i> against them, which is a Piece of <i>Copper-money</i>
they put upon the Wound, take it off 24 Hours after, and apply
a Plaister of Honey and Vinegar. The <i>Holstein</i> Ambassadors say
they are very black, of the Length and Thickness of a Man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Finger, and run faster than Crab-fishes, with their Tails always
erected<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c019'><sup>[188]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>We read of a certain Emperor of <i>Persia</i>, who designing to
make a Tour into <i>Media</i>, durst not undertake the Journey, for
the vast Quantity of <i>Scorpions</i> lying in the Road: So that he was
obliged to detach a great Number of stout Fellows to destroy
those pestiferous Animals, promising a superior Reward to them
that kill’d most: Till this Execution was over, he durst not venture
his dignified Carcass abroad. The <i>Scythian Scorpions</i> are of
the large Size, and terrible when they shoot their Stings.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Madagascar</i>, a large <i>African</i> Island, are several Sorts of
Scorpions, particularly <i>Water-Scorpions</i>, that lie in the Marshes
and standing Waters, which are very mischievous, killing Dogs
and Beasts, and then sucking their Blood. There is another Sort
of Scorpions with a great round black Belly, that are very dangerous;
for those whom they strike immediately swoon, and
some for two Days are weak, and cold as Ice. The only Remedy
they have, is that used against Serpent’s Wounds, <i>viz.</i> to set
the Patient by a great Fire, and giving him Antidotes to expel the
Poison, which proves a Cure<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c019'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Italy</i>, <i>Land-Scorpions</i> are call’d <i>Scurtificio</i>, because they
have their Poison <i>nel-pizzo</i>, in the Extremity of their Tail.
Among the <i>Germans</i>, <i>pizzo</i> is <i>sharp</i>, as <i>spits als een naalde</i>, pointed
as a Needle: The Country people bring them in Sack-fuls to
<i>Florence</i>, and take them out with naked Hands, as if they were
so many Eels, which supposes them to be of the innocent Kind,
like those <i>white Scorpions</i> in <i>Pharos</i>, a little Island in the Mouth
of <i>Nilus</i>, where there is plenty of these pacifick Animals, who offer
no Violence to their Neighbours. Mention is made of other
Provinces where they live and hurt no body<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c019'><sup>[190]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the <i>Spaniards</i> the <i>Scorpion</i> is call’d <i>Alaicran</i>, from an
Island in <i>America</i>, called the <i>Island of Scorpions</i>, for the numerous
Multitude that ravage the Place. In <i>Brasil</i> is a vast Number of
<i>Scorpions</i>, and some four or five Foot long, in Shape like those of
<i>Europe</i>; but not so venemous: Some of them chuse to kill themselves
rather than die by the Hands of an Enemy. A certain
Gentleman who made the Trial observes, that a Scorpion being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>surrounded with a Circle of burning Coals, chose to sting itself to
Death rather than be burnt.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Ceylon</i> in the <i>East-Indies</i>, they have many Species of Serpents;
as,</p>
<p class='c033'>XXIII. The <i>Pimbera Serpent</i>, whose Body is said to be as
big as a Man’s Middle, and in Length proportionable. The
Creatures of this Kind secure their Prey, even horned Beasts
(which sometimes are pretty large) by a sort of a Peg, or <i>pointed
Hook</i>, that grows upon the Extremity of the Tail: They are slow
in Motion, and therefore skulk in hollow Places; and when they
have taken the Spoil, tho’ horned, they swallow it alive, and
whole; which often proves fatal, because the Horns may gore the
Belly. More, further on.</p>
<p class='c033'>XXIV. The <i>Noya Serpent</i> is another ill-natur’d <i>Indian</i>, about
four Foot long, will stand with its Body half upright two or three
Hours together, thereby displaying an Air of Majesty: The Inhabitants
call it the <i>King’s Snake</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Poison in that Part of the Country operates variously:
Some after they are bitten, fall into a profound Sleep,
and without speedy Help die in about six Hours time: Others
grow distracted, and if neglected die in twenty-four Hours, and
bleed at all the Pores of the Body, and are irrecoverable: Of

</div>

<p class='c033'>XXV. The <i>Polonga Serpent</i> is five or six Foot long, and a
most venemous Creature, destroying all manner of Animals that
fall within its Circuit, as well as Men, Women and Children.
When the <i>Noya</i> and <i>Polonga</i> Serpents happen to meet, a bloody
Battle ensues; they fight till one be kill’d, and then the Conqueror
eats up the slain.</p>
<p class='c033'>XXV. The <i>Cobres Capellos</i>, Sea-serpents from eight to ten
Yards long, are most dangerous Beasts and frequently kill People
in that Country<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c019'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When <i>Alexander</i> was in the <i>East-Indies</i>, he and his <i>Macedonians</i>
were strangely alarm’d by an Army of Serpents that sallied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>upon ’em from the Woods, which would soon have destroy’d
them, but for the Humanity of a <i>Native</i>, who directed them to
a certain Herb that cured their Wounds, and saved them from
Ruin<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c019'><sup>[193]</sup></a>. The same Historian adds, that in those great Deserts,
frequent and terrible Scuffles happened between Elephants and
Serpents about Water, when they met at a Spring, and it so fell
out some time, that both perish’d; for the Serpent roll’d it self
about the Elephant’s Leg by several Folds, who finding himself
wounded, falls down, and in falling often crushes his Enemy to
death. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>America</i> is a vast variety of Serpents, and some of prodigious
Dimensions; in particular, they are very numerous and
large in <i>Cordillera</i>, i. e. <i>Andes</i>, or high Mountains of <i>Chile</i>,
which Mountains, <i>Antonio de Herrera</i> calls a Prodigy of Nature,
not to be match’d in the kind: They are two Chains of high
Mountains, about 1500 Leagues in length: In that spacious Region
are Adders red as blood, seven or eight Foot long, which
in the Night appear like burning Coals, but not so dangerous as
other Serpents, that are Imps of Darkness. <i>Acosta</i> and other
Writers tell us, that the Devil appear’d among the <i>Americans</i> in
the shape of a Serpent.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are so many Sorts, says <i>Nieuhoff</i>, that the <i>Brasilians</i>
reckon up no less than thirty-two, most of which are here accounted
for.</p>
<p class='c033'>XXVII. The <i>Caudisonant</i>, or <i>Rattle-snake</i>, is a large Species
of the Viper, and in its exterior Form every way similar, the
rustling Tail excepted; it moves with as much Agility as if supply’d
with Wings, called therefore the <i>Flying-snake</i>: It has small
Eyes, and four Teeth longer than the rest, of white Colour, and
sharp, like Thorns; the Head is guarded with small Scales, the
Back with larger and thicker Armour; the Tail is composed of
several loose bony Articulaments that make a roaring Sound, loud
enough to be heard at a distance; and therefore called the <i>Bell-Snake</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is common in <i>Virginia</i>, where it appears to be from three
to four Foot long, and reckoned to be very poisonous; but scarcely
hurts any, unless provoked; and when offended, like the God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of War, makes directly at the Enemy, without dread of Consequences.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the History of <i>Peru</i>, an Account is given of a young Woman
who was wounded by a Rattle-snake, and died on the Spot,
before any Relief could be had; and when they came to take up
the Corpse, the Flesh came off her Bones; so speedily did the
violence of the Poison dissolve the structure of the Body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method of killing this Snake, is thus given by Captain
<i>Silas Taylor</i>, <i>viz.</i> Of the Leaves of <i>Dittany</i> of <i>Virginia</i> (<i>i. e.</i>
wild Penny-royal) bruis’d, we took, says he, and having fasten’d
them at the end of a cloven Stick, we held it to the Nose of the
<i>Rattle-snake</i>, who by turning and wriggling, labour’d hard to avoid
it; but was kill’d with it in less than half an Hour’s time, and as
is supposed by the meer Scent of that Vegetable<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c019'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. This was done
<i>A. D.</i> 1657, in <i>July</i>, at which Season those Creatures are reputed
to be in the greatest Vigour for their Poison: It is also remarkable,
that in those Places where this wild Penny-royal
grows, none of these Snakes are observed to come<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c019'><sup>[195]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bruised Leaves of the <i>Virginian</i> Dittany are very hot, and
biting upon the Tongue: Probably the strong Smell of it might
stop the Passages of Respiration in those Animals, or ferment
with the Blood, so as to suffocate them. In <i>Gresham</i> College at
<i>London</i> may be seen fifteen Skins of Rattle-snakes checker’d——Some
appear in ash colour: Several Rattles of those Snakes,
most of them composed of above ten Joints.</p>
<p class='c033'>XXVIII. The <i>Salamander</i> is an amphibious Serpent, very
much spotted; superior in Bulk to common Lizards.
The <i>Land-Salamander</i> is a little poisonous Reptile, that resembles
the green Lizard, but more gross in Body; and is found
in <i>Germany</i> and other Places.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>CONRADUS Gesner</i>, says he saw one of ’em on the <i>Alps</i>
perfectly black, with a short Tail: When wounded, a kind of
milky Liquid runs out. In <i>Germany</i>, are several great Woods,

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>This little strange Animal affects moist, cold and solitary
Habitations. In some parts of <i>Germany</i> great numbers of them
have been found in a Body piled up, one upon another: They
are of the oviparous kind, and propagate their Species by Eggs,
the common Semen of Fowls and Insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>They are Enemies to Frogs and the Tortoise, and feed on
little small Insects; and when they have Access to Honey and
Milk, they never want a Feast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is of a poisonous Nature, and many have suffer’d by its
Biting; so says <i>Pliny</i>, with whom agree <i>Nicander</i>, <i>Aëtius</i>, and
<i>Abensinæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>GESNER</i> is in a contrary Sentiment, and says he had domestick
<i>Salamanders</i>, that offered no violence with their Teeth
without Provocation. <i>Jonstonus</i> adds, that in <i>Germany</i> there appeared
no ill Effects of its Bite; but in <i>France</i> its Wounds were
of a most deadly Nature, as appears by a Saying in that Kingdom.
<i>viz.</i> <i>That a Man bit by a Salamander, should have as many Physicians

whose Eggs are as large as Garden-pears.</p>

<p class='c013'>The common Report is, that the <i>Salamander</i> is able to live

observes, that upon Trial made, it was so far from quenching
it, that it consum’d immediately<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c019'><sup>[199]</sup></a>. It is true, that <i>Newts</i>
(or Water-lizards) Frogs, Snails, and such icy Animals, will
endure the Fire for a longer time than others will, by reason of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>an extraordinary degree of Coldness, which dissipates and scatters

<p class='c013'>I have read an Experiment made upon a <i>Salamander</i>, that
was thrown into the Fire, and there came from it a sort of gelid,
moist, viscous Humour, which resisted the Power of Fire for a
little time; but those Exhalations being dried up, was soon consum’d.
In the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, we have another Instance,
which seems to carry the matter further.</p>

<p class='c013'>M. <i>STENO</i> writes from <i>Rome</i>, that a Knight called <i>Corvini</i>,
had assured him, that having cast a <i>Salamander</i> (brought to him
out of the <i>Indies</i>) into the Fire, the Animal thereupon swelled
presently, and then vomited store of thick slimy Matter, which
did put out the neighbouring Coals, to which the <i>Salamander</i>
retired immediately, putting them out also in the same manner as

Hours, and afterwards lived nine Months; that he had kept it
eleven Months, without any other Food but what it took by
licking the Earth, on which it moved, and on which it had been
brought out of the <i>Indies</i>, which at first was cover’d with a thick
Moisture, but being dried afterwards, the Urine of the Animal
served to moisten the same: Being put upon <i>Italian Earth</i>, it

a little Animal resembling a Lizard, but of a larger and longer Head:
Its Eyes stand out of its Head above one half of their Globe,
which he turns so obliquely, that he sees every thing behind
him: Nature perhaps has given it this Advantage, because its
Legs (by the slowness of its motion) are of no use to avoid his
Enemy, by running away. There is yet something more extraordinary,
in the motion of his Eyes, for when one of them
moves, the other has no motion at all; one looks upward, the
other downwards<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c019'><sup>[206]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Cameleon</i> is said to transform itself into variety of Colours;
perhaps this change may arise from the different reflections of the
Rays of Light: Thus they may put on a brown or whitish Habit,
from Trees of that Colour, on which they sit. Others observe,
that its Colour is changeable, according to the various Passions
that agitate the Creature; <i>e. g.</i> When affected with Joy, ’tis
of an emerald Green, mixt with Orange, etch’d with little grey
and black Strokes: Anger gives it a livid and dusky Colour: Fear
makes it pale, and like faded yellow<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c019'><sup>[209]</sup></a>. All these Colours compose
such a pretty Medley of Shadow and Light, that Nature does

<p class='c013'>For the further Illustration of this Subject, I shall add something
from the Philosophical Transactions about a female Cameleon,
the Skin of which appear’d mixt of several Colours, like a
Medley-cloth. The Colours discernable are green, a sandy yellow:
And indeed one may discern, or at least fancy, some mixture
of all, or most Colours in the Skin, whereof some are more
predominant, at different times: There are some permanent black
Spots on the Head, and Ridge of the Back. But our modern
Naturalists assure us, that its common Colour, when it is at rest,
and in the Shade, is a bluish grey; when ’tis exposed to the
Sun, this grey changes into a darker grey, inclining to a dun
Colour: If ’tis put on a black Hat, it appears to be of a violet
Colour.</p>

<p class='c013'>... Upon Excitation or warming, she becomes suddenly full
of little black Spots, equally dispersed on the sides, with small
black Streaks on the Eyelids; all which afterward do vanish.
The Skin is grain’d with globular Inequalities, like the Leather
call’d Shagreen. The grossest Grain is about the Back and Head,
then on the Legs; on the Sides and Belly, finest; which, perhaps,
in several Postures, may shew several Colours; and when
this Animal is in full Vigour, may also have in some sort, <i>Rationem
Speculi</i>, and reflect the Colours of Bodies adjacent; which,
together with the mixture of Colours in the Skin, may have given
occasion to the old Tradition, <i>of changing into all Colours</i><a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c019'><sup>[210]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain curious Gentleman, made the following Experiment,
when he lived at <i>Smyrna</i>, in <i>Asia-minor</i>: He bought
some <i>Cameleons</i>, to try how long they could be preserved alive
under Confinement; he kept them in a large Cage, and allowed
them the Liberty to take the fresh Air, which they suck’d in
with Pleasure, and made them brisker than ordinary. He never
saw them either eat or drink, but seem’d to live on the Fluid in
which we breathe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Antients were persuaded that <i>Cameleons</i> fed upon the
Air, for which reason one of the Fathers calls it a <i>living Skin</i><a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c019'><sup>[211]</sup></a>;
but now it appears by Experience, that they feed upon different
Insects, as Palmer-worms, Locusts, Beetles, Flies, and also Leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of Vegetables. Father <i>Feuillée</i><a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c019'><sup>[212]</sup></a>, in a Journey into <i>Asia-minor</i>,
opened one of these Animals, and found in its Belly Peach-Leaves,
which were not then digested.——<i>N. B.</i> Digestion is very slow
in <i>Cameleons</i>, which is the reason why they take so little Nourishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same Father mentions a small Lizard, which he saw in
<i>Peru</i>, that was not above an Inch thick, which he calls <i>Chameleontides</i>,
because he changed his Colour, like the <i>Cameleons</i>;
being in a certain Situation, he saw it of a dun Colour; in another,
’twas green.... This little Creature, he says, had the same
Figure and Proportion as the <i>Great Lizard</i>; nam’d by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
<i>Iquanna</i>; and <i>Senembi</i>, by <i>Marcgravius</i>; and he makes
that <i>Lizard</i> a fourth kind of <i>Cameleon</i>, and to be added to the
two kinds of <i>Bellonius</i>, one of which is to be found in <i>Arabia</i>,
and the other in <i>Egypt</i>, and to that mention’d by <i>Faber</i>, <i>Lynceus</i>,
which may be seen in <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Tongue is somewhat peculiar, it being as long as their
Body, with which they catch Flies, and other Insects, which
settle on their Tongues, to suck the viscous slimy Matter, adherent
to them. The <i>Cameleon</i> puts out his Tongue to draw them
upon it, and when ’tis full of these Insects, he pulls it in with
wonderful Agility. Others think, it encloses its Prey with
the tip of its Tongue, which is made in a form proper for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Cameleon</i> is an oviparous Animal. <i>J. Jonstonus</i> says, it
has above a hundred Eggs, from <i>Piereskius</i>, who nursed a Female
on purpose to make Observations upon the Subject<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c019'><sup>[213]</sup></a>. After
all the Gentleman’s Care about ’em at <i>Smyrna</i>, all of them
died within five Months; and having opened the Female, found
thirty Eggs in her, fasten’d one to another in the form of a
Chain. <i>Ibid. supra.</i></p>

that goes there by the Name of <i>Gekho</i>, from the Noise it makes

Rings round it, and its Teeth sharp, and strong enough to penetrate
an Armour of Steel: it has a slow Motion, but where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>fastens, ’tis not easily disengaged. This Creature is found in
<i>Arabia</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Madagascar</i>, <i>Java</i>, and other parts of <i>India</i>.

says it frequents <i>Cairo</i>, and other Places, is found among Hedges
and Bushes; mutes like a Hawk; swallows every thing whole. It
moves the Feet of each side alternately, but runs up Trees very
fast, and lays hold on the Boughs with its Tail. <i>Leo</i> and <i>Sandys</i>
say, the Neck is inflexible, and it can’t turn without moving its
whole Body: the Back is crooked, the Skin is spotted with little
Tumours: the Tail long and slender, like that of a Rat, when
it sucks in the Air, its Belly swells, whence some think that the
Air is part of its Food. One Author says, it subsists only upon
Air; another says, ’tis a vulgar Error.——</p>

<p class='c033'>XXX. <i>KUKURUKI</i>, a Serpent of <i>Brasil</i> in <i>South-America</i>,
which is under the torrid Zone, where their Winter begins in
<i>March</i> and ends in <i>August</i>; and is like our Summer. This Serpent
is of an ash Colour, and in its Scales resembles the <i>Bocinga</i>,
or Rattle-Snake, but is more gross; on the Back, variegated with
yellow, and large black Spots. ’Tis represented as a very venemous
Animal, eight or nine Foot long<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c019'><sup>[218]</sup></a>; and when prepared,
the Inhabitants feed upon it.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXI. The <i>Ibiara</i> is a <i>Brasilian</i> Adder, about a Foot and
half long; an Inch and half in thickness. Serpents of this kind
are very numerous in that Country, and nothing more poisonous
than their Wounds, tho’ not incurable, if proper Remedies be
applied in time.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>In Seasons of Danger, they shelter themselves in Cavities under
Ground, and feed upon Pismires, which are very large in that
Country, and in such prodigious Quantities, that the  <i>Portuguese</i>
call them, <i>Kings of Brasil</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXII. In <i>Chiapa</i>, in <i>Old-Mexico</i>, now call’d <i>New-Spain</i>,
is a noxious Animal call’d <i>Teuthlacokauqui</i>, or <i>Fortress of the Serpents</i>,
whose Head is like an Adder, thick Belly, glittering Scales,
the Ridge of the Body black, with an Interspersion of white
Crosses; the Teeth poisonous, and the biting kills in twenty-four
hours, unless the wounded part be held in the Earth so long,
till the Pain be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has a frightful Aspect; when it moves it makes a Noise
with its Tail, that sounds an Alarm of Danger. The <i>Americans</i>,
who have the Art of taking it by the Tail, carry it home,
and by degrees make it tame: ’tis maintain’d at a cheap rate, for
it can subsist a whole Year without any visible Food.</p>

from <i>Marcgravius</i> and <i>Piso</i>. The former says, ’tis four Foot and
three Fingers long, Belly smooth, small Eyes, forked Tongue, rattling
Tail. The other observes, the <i>Spaniards</i> call it <i>Cascavel</i>, and
<i>Tangedor</i>, because its Tail emits the sound of a Ball; in thickness,
as a Man’s Arm; in length, about five Foot; a cloven Tongue,
long and sharp Teeth; of a dark Colour, inclining to the

<p class='c013'>Now we are in <i>Mexico</i>, excuse me in giving you two Instances
of monstrous Cruelty; one in the Natives, the other in
the <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the <i>Mexicans</i> were disposed to do signal Honour to
their Idols, they sent out Armies to bring in Prisoners for a Sacrifice,
whose Flesh they did afterwards eat; and <i>Montezuma</i> the
Emperor, commonly sacrificed 20000 Men, one year with another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and no less than 50000 some years. The Priests thought
it dishonourable to sacrifice less than 40 or 50 Captives at a time
to one <i>Idol</i>. At a certain Festival, they ript up the Breast of a
manumitted Slave, pull’d out his Heart, which they offer’d to the
Sun, and then eat up his Body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their Priests were bloody Men, a Brood of Vipers, and
had such an Ascendant over their Princes, that they made them
believe <i>their Gods were angry</i>, and not to be appeased without
4000 or 5000 Men to sacrifice in a day; so that, right or wrong,
they must make War on their Neighbours, to procure those
Victims to keep their Priests in Humour.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next, is an Instance of <i>Spanish Cruelty</i>, in this Country,
that could have no Original but Hell, the Seat of the old Serpent.
It runs thus, <i>viz.</i> <i>Barthol. de las Casas</i> Bishop of <i>Chiapa</i>, in a
Letter to the <i>Emperor Charles V.</i> gives this account of the Barbarity
of the <i>Spaniards</i> towards the poor Inhabitants, Natives of
the Land.</p>

<p class='c032'>... “Their Kings and Princes, says the Bishop, the <i>Spaniards</i>
scorch’d to death, or tore in pieces with Dogs: The
poor People they burnt in their Houses, and dash’d out the
Brains of their Children: Those that were spared, they forced
to carry greater Burdens than they were able to bear, by which
thousands of them were destroy’d: Others who escap’d, died of
Famine in the Woods, after they had kill’d their own Wives
and Children, and eat them for hunger. In this one Province
they murder’d above two Millions of Men, not sparing those of
Quality, who had civilly entertain’d them. They tortured the
Natives with the most hellish Inventions, to make them discover
their Gold. <i>Diego de Valesco</i>, in particular, spared none that

thousand: He hang’d thirteen Noblemen.</p>

<p class='c035'>“Some they starved to death, by thrusting their Heads betwixt

<i>N. B.</i> This <i>Barth. de las Casas</i> had been a <i>Friar</i>, and afterwards

is commonly found among <i>Friars</i>. It was he, who procur’d the

about half a Crown a Week.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXIII. The <i>Ibitobaca</i> is a Serpent of <i>Chiapa</i>, near four
Foot long, and of a crimson Colour, adorn’d with a pleasing
Diversity of black and white Specks; wearing its Bones as a
Necklace, or the Ruff in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, who destroy’d

<p class='c033'>XXXIV. The <i>Iquanna</i> is the Birth of <i>Mexico</i>, a Serpent
like the Pope’s Anathema, of a terrible Front, but harmless; a
glittering Comb on the Head, with a Bag under the Chin; a
long Tail, and sharp Bones on its Back, standing up in the form
of a Saw.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Iquannatick Serpent is of the amphibious kind, equally
fitted to live by Land or Water; a Privilege which no Son of
<i>Adam</i> can boast of. It is of the oviparous Tribe, and a great
Breeder, laying about fifty Eggs at the Season as big as Acorns,
which are of a very good Taste, and good Food when boiled,
and so is the Serpent itself; but the Land-<i>Iquanna</i> is a more pleasant
Food, and preferable to <i>Spanish</i> Ragous<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c019'><sup>[222]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXV. The <i>Ibiboboca</i> is a Serpent beautiful to the Eye, but

it in <i>Gresham-College</i> is above three Yards<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c019'><sup>[223]</sup></a>, white as Snow, decorated

the <i>Roebuck Serpent</i>, because it can swallow a whole Buck at once.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>After swallowing it down, it generally falls asleep, and in that
Posture is frequently taken, while digesting its Supper. My Author

<p class='c033'>XXXVII. The <i>Jararaka Serpent</i>, is another <i>Brasilian</i>, no
longer than a Man’s Arm to the Elbow; it has swelling Veins
on its Head; the Skin is covered with red and black Spots; the
rest is of an Earth Colour: Its Wounds are dangerous, and attended
with the usual Symptoms. There are three Sorts of these venemous
Snakes besides this, <i>viz</i>. <i>One</i> sort is about ten Spans long,
with two terrible Tusks, or great Teeth, which they stretch out
to a great length, and strike them into their Prey. The venemous
Liquid, which is very yellow, works with a Violence, that
kills in a few Hours. The <i>second</i> sort resembles the <i>Spanish Viper</i>
in Colour and Form, and is equally dangerous. The <i>third</i> and
worst sort very much resembles the <i>first</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXVIII. The <i>Biobi</i>, called <i>Gabro Verde</i> by the <i>Portuguese</i>
in <i>Brasil</i>, i. e. the <i>Green Serpent</i>, because its Colour is porraceous,
a shining Green like the Leek; it is between three and four Foot
long, and about the Thickness of a Man’s Thumb; a large
Mouth, and black Tongue, and has this good Property, that it
hurts nobody unless irritated; but when provoked, no Poison
more dangerous. We read of a <i>Soldier</i>, who accidentally treading
on this Serpent, was wounded by it in the Thigh, and died a
few Hours after, tho’ the Remedies that proved successful on the
like occasions, had been diligently applied<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c019'><sup>[225]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XXXIX. The <i>Caninana Serpent</i>, is another Inhabitant of
<i>Brasil</i>, green on the back, and yellow on the Belly, about two
Foot long, and reckoned not to be so venemous, as the rest of
that mischievous Tribe. It feeds upon Eggs and Birds, at last becomes
the common Entertainment of the <i>American</i> and <i>African</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Tables<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c019'><sup>[226]</sup></a>. We read of other <i>green Serpents</i> in the <i>Indies</i>, that
are indulged with little Cottages made of Straw, where they spend
their solitary Hours, till the time of eating invites them out, then
they repair to the House, where they fawn upon their Masters,
and eat what is set before them, and then retire to the Huts of
Indulgence.</p>

<p class='c033'>XL. The <i>Tetzawhcoatl</i>, is another Production of <i>Brasil</i>, a
Serpent of about three Foot long, and slender Body, whose Strokes
are pestilent: The Head is black, nether Part of the Tail reddish,
and the Belly dash’d with black Spots. The Cure is by Suction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now we are travelling among the Inhabitants of <i>Brasil</i>, we
may be allowed to take notice of Prince <i>Maurice</i>’s <i>Rational Parrot</i>,
mentioned by Sir <i>William Temple</i> and Mr. <i>Locke</i>, which the
<i>former</i> had from the Prince’s own Mouth. His Words were,</p>

<p class='c032'>... “That he had heard of such an <i>old Parrot</i>, when
he came to <i>Brasil</i>, and tho’ he believed nothing of it, and it
was a good way off; yet he had so much Curiosity as to send
for it: that it was a very great and a very old one; and when
it came first into the Room, where the Prince was with a great
many Dutchmen about him, it said presently, <i>What a Company
of White-men are here!</i> They ask’d it, what he thought that
Man was, pointing at the Prince? it answered, <i>Some General
or other</i>. The Prince asked it, Whence come ye<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c019'><sup>[227]</sup></a>? The Parrot
answered, <i>From Marinnan</i>. To whom do you belong,
said the Prince? it answered, <i>To a Portuguese Prince</i>. The
Prince ask’d, What do you there? Parrot answered, <i>I look
after the Chickens</i>. The Prince laugh’d, and said, You look
after the Chickens! The Parrot answered, <i>Yes, I; and I
know well enough how to do it</i>, and made the <i>Chuck</i> four or five
times, that People use to make to Chickens, when they call
them....”</p>

<p class='c032'>... “I could not but tell this odd Story, because it is so much
out of the way, and from the first hand, and what may pass for
a good one; for I dare say, this Prince at least believed himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>in all he told me, having ever past for a very honest and pious
Man. I leave it to Naturalists to reason, and to other Men to
believe as they please upon it; however, it is not perhaps amiss
to relieve or enliven a busy Scene sometimes with such Digressions,
whether to the purpose or no.” So far Sir <i>William Temple</i>.</p>

<p class='c031'>Wonder not then, if you meet in this History with some
romantick Sentiments entertained by learned Men concerning Serpents,
when two such illustrious Pillars of the Commonwealth
of Letters, give way to a Relation that has so much of the Marvellous
in it.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLI. These Historians inform us of many more Serpents,
and some of great bulk, that infest those <i>American</i> Regions;
whose Looks are ruddy, of blood-red Colour, that shine in the
Night, like so many glittering Stars.</p>

<p class='c013'>A modern Author writes, that in <i>America</i> are some Snakes
that were eight Foot long, and as red as Blood, which in the
Night look’d like Fire<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c019'><sup>[228]</sup></a>.</p>

II. in his Account of <i>Darien</i>, p. 72.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The former black, and these shining Serpents, remind me
of the <i>Obsidian</i> Stones, that are very black and transparent; they
have their Names from one <i>Obsidius</i>, who first found them in
<i>Æthiopia</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a sort of natural <i>Obsidian</i> Glass, which is rather to be
ranked among Stones than Metals; ’tis as passive as the former,
enduring the Graving-Tool, is diaphanous and pellucid, receiving
Images, and, like artificial Glass, transmitting all Forms and
Shapes.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is found in <i>Æthiopia</i>, where the Sepulchres of the Nobles
are usually made of it, and after this manner; <i>viz.</i> They
take a large Stone, and make it hollow, and in the Cavity include
the Corps, where it is not only preserved, but, as if entomb’d in
Glass, is apparently visible to Spectators, and sends forth no ungrateful
Scent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Out of these <i>Obsidian</i> Stones, Looking-Glasses are wont to
be made, and are also found on the Coasts of <i>Arabia</i>. These
shining Stones were inserted into Rings, and in one of them was
cut the entire Image of <i>Augustus</i>, who being much taken with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>these Stones of Glass, caused four Elephants to be made of them,—See
the <i>Commentary</i> upon <i>Pancirollus</i>, B. i. of <i>Jet</i>; and <i>Pliny</i>, B. xxxvi. c. 26.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLII. <i>Boiguacu</i>, another venemous Production of <i>Brazil</i>,
thick in the middle, and declining towards the Extremities
of the Body; ’tis covered with large Scales on the Back, and
lesser ones on the Belly, which is common in all Serpents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole is adorned with elegant Variegations.... The
Back and Sides set off with black Spots, inclining to the round;
about three Inches distant from each other, and in the Centre a
round white Spot. These beautiful Appearances, says <i>Jonstonus</i>,
have a Grandeur in them more than rivals Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw several Serpents of this kind: On <i>August</i> 7th, 1638,
one that was eight Foot long. Another, <i>August</i> 13th, 1638,
above five Foot long, its Flesh fat, and very white; the Heart
being taken out, lived about 15 Minutes. <i>October</i> 16th, 1638,
he saw another, that was near nine Foot long, and he was a Witness
to its swallowing a She-Goat whole<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c019'><sup>[229]</sup></a>. By the Description,
this Serpent must be the <i>Lyboia</i>, so famous for the Knack of Deglutition
of Animals.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c033'>XLIII. The <i>Brasilian Serpent</i>, called the <i>Ibiracoan</i>, makes
its Appearance in a Habit of various Colours, trimmed with red,
black and white Spots. Under this fine Dress, is a poisonous
Spring; the Wound it gives, infallibly kills without immediate
Assistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the Poison reaches the Heart, the common Practice
is, to secure that Serpent, and boil the Flesh of it with certain
Roots, and give it the Patient in Wine, or any other proper Liquid,
and it will answer the Intention.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLIV. The <i>Tarciboya</i>, and <i>Kakaboya</i>, are two Serpents much
of the same Nature, and therefore I put them together: They are
occasional Inhabitants of the Water and Land; in Colour black,
and about six Hands in Length. If they hurt any Creature, it is
only in Defence of themselves, and the Wound is easily cured by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Remedies well known in those Countries. They are great Devourers
of Birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here the Learned <i>Ray</i>, from <i>Piso</i>, mentions ten other Serpents,
whose particular Characters he considers in his Description
of Fishes; then refers his Reader to those described by <i>Joan. de
Laet</i>.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c019'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c033'>XLV. The <i>Bibera</i> is a venemous Lizard of <i>Brazil</i>. If you
ask, What are these <i>Brasilian Lizards</i>? I answer, They are creeping
Serpents, of various Colours, and different Sizes: Some are the
length of a Finger, others many Feet; have sparkling Eyes.
There is only one sort of them that is venemous, among which
is this <i>Bibera</i>: they are like the others, but lesser, and are most
mischievous. They are of an ash Colour, inclining to the white;
the Body and Limbs seem thick, but the Tail is short and broad.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Wounds given by these Serpents, are full of a thin stinking
Matter, attended with blue Swellings, and Pain in the Heart
and Bowels. <i>N. B.</i> Great Things have been frequently done by
little Things.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLVI. The <i>Ambua</i>, so the Natives of <i>Brazil</i> call the <i>Millepedes</i>
and the <i>Centipedes</i> Serpents. Those Reptiles of thousand
Legs bend as they craul along, and are reckoned very poisonous.
Those Lizards of hundred Legs are commonly found in the
Woods, where they destroy the Fruit, and also do mischief both
to Men and Cattle.</p>

<p class='c013'>In these <i>Multipedes</i>, the Mechanism of the Body is very curious;
in their going, it is observable, that on each side of their
Bodies, every Leg has its Motion, one regularly after another;
so that their Legs, being numerous, form a kind of Undulation,
and thereby communicate to the Body a swifter Progression than
one could imagine, where so many short Feet are to take so many
short Steps, that follow one another, rolling on, like the Waves of
the Sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Palmer-Worm</i> is also called <i>Millepes</i>, because of its many
Feet, which are as Bristles under its Body: It is about six Inches
long, and moves with incredible Swiftness. The upper part of
the Body is cover’d with hard swarthy Scales, and it has a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Claws both in its Head and Tail, of rank Poison, as the Historian
says.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLVII. The <i>Jebeya</i> is another <i>Brazilian</i>, and a Serpent very
ravenous and destructive: It has four Legs, and a long Tail like
a <i>Crocodile</i>; it lies flat and close on the Ground, artfully concealing
itself, ’till the Prey comes within reach, and then darts out
a couple of sharp Fins from its Fore-quarters, and kills whatever
it strikes.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLVIII. The <i>Giraupiagara</i> is an <i>American</i> Serpent, so call’d,
because of its being a great Devourer of Eggs. ’Tis of a Negro-Colour,
but a yellow Breast, and of great Length and Agility.
It glides (as if swimming) on the tops of Trees, faster than any
Man can run on the Ground.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c019'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r231'>231</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Nieuhoff in Atlas, America.</i></p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>It lives upon Birds, whose Nests it constantly plunders. ’Tis
observable, that the <i>Cuckow</i> feeds very much upon <i>Eggs</i>, which
accounts for the vulgar Notion, that it always has one or more
little Birds, as Menials to attend it, these being some of those,
whose Houses it plundered. There is another Charge preferred
against the Cuckow, <i>viz.</i> The Contempt it puts upon our Vegetables,
by spitting upon them; whereas in those Dobs of frothy
Dew, we find little Green Insects, that are Grashoppers in the
Embryo.</p>
<p class='c033'>XLIX. The <i>Caminana</i> is another <i>Brazilian Serpent</i>, of a
great length. The Body is all over green, and very beautiful in
prospect. This also runs up the Trees, not so much because of
the green Leaves, as in pursuit of Birds of all Colours; and having
devoured the Contents of the Nest, seizes the Dam, and
drinks her Blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pleasing Appearance made by this Serpent in <i>Green</i>, puts
me in mind of the <i>Turks</i>, who have so great a <i>Superstition for the
green Colour</i> (because it was consecrated to <i>Mahomet</i>) that they
forbid Christians to wear it on pain of Death; but the <i>Persians</i>
(who are <i>Mahometans</i> as well as the <i>Turks</i>) allow it to every body,
and laugh at this Superstition; so that when <i>Sultan Amurath</i>
sent an Ambassador to <i>Sha-Abbas</i> of <i>Persia</i>, to complain that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>suffer’d that <i>venerable Colour</i> to be prophaned by Christians, he
scoffingly said, that he would forbid the <i>green Colour</i> to be prophaned
by Christians, as soon as <i>Amurath</i> would hinder the <i>green
Meadows</i> to be prophaned by his <i>Turkish Cattle</i><a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c019'><sup>[232]</sup></a>. The Eastern
<i>Turks</i> abhor the <i>blue Colour</i>, because the <i>Jews</i>, they say, threw
<i>Indigo</i> into <i>Jordan</i> to hinder the Baptism of
<i>Christ</i>, but the Angels brought Water from <i>Jordan</i> to
baptize him, before it was polluted. <i>Atlas.</i></p>

<p class='c033'>L. <i>BOYTIAPUA</i>, is a Serpent so called by the <i>Brazilians</i>
for its long Snout, though I don’t find it exceeds others in smelling,
by the extension of its Nose; it is of a long slender Body,
and feeds upon Frogs, amphibious Animals and Insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Serpent is in high Esteem among the Natives of <i>Brazil</i>,
who practise the Art of Conjuration by it; and if any of them
have a barren Wife, and are desirous of Children, they lash this
Serpent over her Hips, pretending that such Exercise will make
her fruitful: And if this Device should take effect, must not we
conclude the Offspring to be a <i>Generation of Vipers</i>?</p>

<p class='c033'>LI. The <i>Gaytiepua</i> is a large Snake, smells rank like a Fox, and,
according to a learned Author, the Smell is intolerable<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c019'><sup>[233]</sup></a>, as is that
of the Serpent <i>Boyana</i>, which is very long and slender, and of

<p class='c033'>LII. The <i>Bom-Snake</i>, is another <i>Brazilian</i> Reptile, call’d
<i>Bom</i> from the Noise it makes in its Motion. It is of a prodigious
large Size, but is class’d among the Innocent, that do no manner

<p class='c013'>How many Animals of the same kind in the moral Creation,
that wear gaudy Feathers and Plumes, whose Sound, in the Assemblies
of Saints and Sinners, proves to  be <i>vox &amp; præterea
nihil</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>LIII. The <i>Boicupecanga</i> is a Serpent, so called because its
Back looks as if it were overgrown with Briers and Thorns, the
Ridge being sharp pointed, which makes the Beast look as if he
were guarded by little Spears: This prickle-back’d Serpent is of
a monstrous Extension, very frightful, and venemous, the very
sight of which strikes Terror into Man and Beast.</p>
<p class='c033'>LIV. The <i>Cucurijuba</i> is a Water-Snake of twenty-five or
thirty Foot long, and three Foot in Compass, will swallow a Hog
or a Stag at once; has Teeth like those of Dogs, but makes no
use of them as Instruments of Mastication.
<i>HARRIS</i> in the <i>Atlas America</i>, mentions one kill’d when
asleep, that was twelve Yards and a half long, and proportionably
big, in whose Belly they found two wild Boars. This Creature
I take to be the <i>Lyboya</i>, (or a near Relative) a gigantick Serpent,
already described, therefore I dismiss the Monster, and proceed
to the</p>
<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>LV. <i>MANIMA</i>, another Water-Snake, of the same Proportion
with the former, if not more bulky: The sight is terrible;
the Monstrosity of Dimensions is sufficient to render it so;
but we are told, the Terror vanishes in some Degree upon a view
of the Skin, which is exquisitely painted, and the <i>Brazilians</i> not
only love to see so spruce an Animal, but reckon it an Omen of
a long Life.</p>

<p class='c013'>If you ask, What a long Life is? I answer, ’Tis nothing but
a lingering, slow Consumption: Life itself, what is it, but a meer
practical Tautology, a Repetition of the same things over and
over, and looks more like a Penance imposed upon Mankind than
Pleasure.</p>
<p class='c033'>LVI. The <i>Terpomongo</i> is another Serpent, which in the <i>Brazilian</i>
Dialect, signifies to <i>stick close</i>, so close to whatever it touches,
that it is not to be parted. It is about the bigness of a Cable-Rope,
which being fasten’d to the Anchor, holds the Ship fast
when it rides.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Property in the Serpent, may be an Hieroglyphick; or
Symbol of true Friendship, which is a sacred Mixture: My Friend
and I are as two Rivers joined in one, not to be separated; we
stick close and fast, traversing the Wilderness hand-in-hand: He
who strikes one, wounds the other—No Schism in true Friendship.</p>
<p class='c033'>LVII. <i>JACORE Lizard</i>; some of these Serpents are as big
as Dogs, and resemble them in the Nose; their Teeth large and
long, and their Skin impenetrable. They do no harm to their
Neighbours, and therefore are generally allow’d to live. They
make a loud Noise, by which their Haunts are discovered, and
their Liberty hazarded.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay Eggs as large as those of a Goose, of an elastick
Nature, so hard, that when one is struck against another, they
ring like Iron: they frequent both Land and Water.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s observable here, that this Animal is obstreporous, and by
its Noise invites Danger; whereas Silence would be his Security:
yea, its Eggs are as so many roaring Bells. This may serve for
a Document to the unruly Member: <i>Thersites</i>, in <i>Homer</i>, was
counted a Fool for babbling. A talkative Tongue is the Spring,
Ringleader, and Head of Faction in all places.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The first Rudiments in <i>Pythagoras</i>’s School, was <i>Quinquennian</i>,
<i>Silence</i>. The Scholars were not allow’d to talk for five Years,
that is, till they had learned the <i>Art of Silence</i>. <i>Harpocrates</i> was
the <i>God of Silence</i>, therefore painted with his Finger on his Lip,
and was worshipped in <i>Egypt</i> with <i>Isis</i> and <i>Serapis</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>ANGERONA</i> was the Goddess of Silence at <i>Rome</i>, and
painted with a Cloth about her Mouth. Nor is it less venerable
at <i>Venice</i>, where after they come out of the Senate-house, they
are as silent about what was said and done, as if they had power
to forget all that was said and done.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the above-mention’d Serpents, the learned Mr. <i>Ray</i> adds,
by way of Supplement, a Catalogue of fifteen <i>East-Indian Serpents</i>,
which he had from the Learned Dr. <i>Tancred Robinson</i>,
whose Descriptions he had from the College at <i>Leyden</i>, which I

</div>

<p class='c033'>LVIII. <i>SERPENS Indicus Coronatus</i>, an <i>Indian</i> Serpent,
that makes its Appearance with a crowned Head, which it holds
up on high, as if proud of the Honour. This is an Emblem of
Pride, that Dropsy of the Mind; to yield to its Thirst, is to
swallow the Bait, that turned the <i>Seraph</i> into a <i>Devil</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Remedy used by the <i>Indians</i> for its Wounds, is what
they call the <i>Serpent-Stone</i>, which, according to <i>Thevenot</i> and
others, is an artificial Composition, and not taken out of this
Serpent’s Head.</p>
<p class='c033'>LIX. <i>VIPERA Indica tricolor major</i>, a Serpent remarkable
for a Body decorated with three fine Colours, the Liveries of
Summer’s Pride, but living much under ground, the Glories of
its Attire are buried in the Earth, <i>the World’s material Mould</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>LX. <i>VIPERA Zelanica minor maculis eleganter variegata</i>,
a Serpent elegantly garnished with a Variety of charming Colours:
It is an Inhabitant of <i>Ceylon</i>, an Island in the <i>East-Indies</i>, called
by the Inhabitants <i>Tenarisain</i>, that is the <i>Land of Delights</i>, and
not without reason is this Island so called, since it is the most
fruitful place in <i>India</i>, producing Gold, Silver, Precious Stones,
plenty of Rice, Ananas, Cocoas, best Oranges, Lemons, Figs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Pomegranates, Ginger, Grapes, Pepper, Cardamum, Tobacco,
Nutmegs, Sugar; Mulberry, which yield much Silk; Palm-trees,
which afford a Liquor for their constant Drink, <i>&amp;c.</i> But in
midst of these pleasing Varieties, they are haunted with various
sorts of venemous Serpents; an Emblem of our present State,
which is a Compound of Pleasure and Pain.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c031'><i>CEYLON</i> is an Emblem of Man, to whom <i>Pleasure</i> is as a
delightful Situation; but in it dwells a Serpent, called <i>Pain</i>. Pleasure
is the principal Intendment of Nature, and the great Object
of our Inclination, without which Life would be no Blessing, but
a Mortification: Yea, ’tis Pleasure reconciles us to Pain; for who
would submit to nauseous Medicines, and Tortures of the Surgeon’s
Knife, but for hope of the Pleasure of Ease that succeeds it.</p>

<p class='c013'>No Serpent so terrible as Pain, which is a strange domineering
Perception, that keeps off Ease when wanted, and destroys
Ease when we are in possession of it.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXI. The <i>Malcarabeta</i> of <i>Ceylon</i> is a Serpent painted by Nature
in a Garb blue and white; the last of these two Colours shew
best by Candle-light. This leads us to the Excommunication by
Inch of Candle; that is, while a little Candle continues burning,
the Sinner is allow’d to come to Repentance; but after it burns
out, he remains excommunicated to all Intents and Purposes.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXII. The <i>Ethetulla</i> is a <i>Ceylonick</i> Serpent; of a little slender
Body, and sharp-pointed Head. This is a kind of Ranger, delights
in Groves and Forests, and may be known by a white and
green Vesture, in which it rambles among the Trees.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXIII. <i>MALPOLON</i> is another Serpent of that celebrated
Island, and of a vermilion Hue, imbroider’d with curious fine red
Spots, which shine like so many Stars.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXIV. <i>SERPENS Putorius</i>, so denominated, probably because
of its filthy Smell; by which it resembles the <i>Putorius</i>, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>little Animal call’d <i>Fitchet</i>, that smells ill, especially when enraged<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c019'><sup>[236]</sup></a>.
<i>Jonstonus</i> and <i>Gesner</i> make it to be the <i>Druinus</i>, which

<p class='c033'>LXV. The <i>Anacandia</i>, a <i>Ceylonick</i> Serpent, of monstrous
Corpulence, being in longitude about 25 Foot. <i>D. Cleyerus</i>, who
accounts for this gigantick Serpent, says, he saw one of them
open’d, in whose Belly was found a whole Stag, with all his integral
Parts: In another they found a wild Goat; and in a third,
a Porcupine arm’d with all its Darts and Prickles<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c019'><sup>[237]</sup></a>. Serpents
of this nature have often fallen in our way, by which we may
imagine, that there is a vast spread of them over the Earth. Mr.
<i>Ray</i> from <i>Cleyerus</i> gives this account of the Monster——Tho’ the
Throat seems narrow, yet ’tis very extensible, and the Facts have
been confirm’d by Experience. When the Prey is catch’d, he
wraps himself about it, takes it by the Nose, sucks the Blood, and
soon reduces it to a Hodge-podge; after he has broken the Bones
in pieces, that emit a Sound like a Gun, <i>ibid.</i> And in doing all
this he spends two days.</p>

<p class='c033'>LXVI. The <i>Ghalghulawa</i> is another <i>Ceylonite</i>, that goes by
the Name of <i>Serpens Indicus Saxatilis</i>, describ’d by whitish Lines,
that run across one another: Whether the Poet refers to this, as
a Serpent affecting stony and gravelly Situations, or to a certain
Fish, I determine not<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c019'><sup>[238]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c033'>LXVII. The <i>Manballa</i> is another <i>Indian</i>, and from its Name
we may conclude it has something of the canine Nature, for it
flies with great Fury at Passengers, as some Dogs usually do. ’Tis
of a light red (or bright bay, as we call it in Horses) spotted
with white.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXVIII. The <i>Nintipolonga</i>, an <i>Indian</i> Serpent, whose Skin
is checker’d with white and black Spots. Its Bite is accompanied
with mortiferous Sleep, therefore call’d <i>Serpens hypnoticus</i>, <i>soporiferous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Serpent</i>, whose Wounds are as an <i>Opiate</i>, or <i>Medicines</i> that
induce sleep, in which they die. <i>Q.</i> Why may not we suppose
this narcotic Poison to be the same with that, which <i>Cleopatra</i>
used in executing the Sentence that <i>Heroine</i> past upon herself?</p>
<p class='c033'>LXIX. The <i>Wepelon</i> Serpent: Nothing is said of it, but that
it resembles an <i>Indian</i> Reed or Cane in form.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXX. <i>SERPENS Fluviatilis</i>, seems to be the <i>Water-Snake</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXI. <i>SERPENS Spadiceus</i>, a Serpent of light red Colour.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXII. Then follows the <i>Ceylonic Hotambœia</i>. Dr. <i>Robinson</i>’s
Account of this Serpent, he had from the learned <i>Hermannus</i>’s
Library.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> Some of these Eastern Serpents may coincide and agree
in Character with those in <i>America</i>, and other Regions. Where
there is such an infinite Variety of them, and delineated by so
many different hands, ’tis difficult to give an exact Description of
every individual Serpent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other parts of the <i>East-Indies</i> (Continent and Islands) are
infested with Serpents of various kinds and sizes, and he must be
more than a Conjurer in History, that can charm them to make
their Appearance in one Place, and all in their proper Habiliments.</p>

<p class='c033'>LXXIII. The <i>hooded</i> or <i>Monk Serpent</i>, found in an Island near
<i>Batavia</i> (a <i>Dutch</i> Settlement in the <i>East-Indies</i>) which differs
from other Serpents in the <i>uncouth Shape of its Head</i>, that looks as
if it were cover’d with a large long <i>Hood</i>, like a <i>Monk’s Cowl</i>, or
the Widow’s Veil, therefore called the <i>hooded Serpent</i>, which is
a very dangerous Animal. Upon a view of its Prey, it immediately
advances towards it, with terrible Rage and Hissing.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the <i>Sieur de la Case</i> was hunting one day in the Woods
adjacent to <i>Batavia</i>, he saw one of these Serpents descending from
a Tree, making a fearful Noise: It was about the thickness of a
Man’s Arm, and in length about eight Foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>This venemous Creature was no sooner on the Ground, but
it made towards him with the greatest Fury; but having a Gun
ready charg’d, he very happily shot it dead, and made off hastily
for fear of a second Attack<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c019'><sup>[239]</sup></a>.</p>

Foot long. <i>N. B.</i> The Skin of one that was 20 Foot long, is
shewn in <i>Batavia</i>, that swallow’d an Infant, <i>ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c033'>LXXIV. The <i>Musk Serpent</i>, so term’d from its musky or
sweet Scent. These sweet-scented Animals are Inhabitants of the
<i>East</i>, between <i>Calicut</i>, the second Kingdom of <i>Malabar</i>, and
<i>Candahor</i>. In <i>Ceylon</i> are Musk-Rats, where the Inhabitants eat
all Rats, but this kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>These Musk-Rats are in all things shaped like our Water-Rats,
only something larger; and in other respects differ only in
that musky Scent. A Gentleman, who kept one of them in a
wooden Chest, observed that two days before it died, ’twas most
odoriferous, and scented the Room above what was common<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c019'><sup>[240]</sup></a>.
In <i>Muscovy</i> is a Water-Rat, which smells like Musk; and also a
great number of <i>Musk-Cats</i>, which look like young <i>Bucks</i> without
Horns, and therefore call’d <i>Musk-Harts</i> by the <i>Chinese</i>, because
they resemble those Creatures. The Musk is contain’d in
a little Excrescence near the Navel<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c019'><sup>[241]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The word <i>Musk</i> comes from the <i>Arabic</i>, <i>Moscha</i>, a Perfume
of strong Scent, only agreeable when moderated by the Mixture
of some other Perfume, by which it becomes an agreeable artificial
Odour.... Musk is found in a little Swelling, like a præternatural
Tumor, or Bag growing (about the Bigness of a Hen’s
Egg) under the Belly of a wild Beast, of the same Name; and
appears to be nothing else, but a kind of bilious Blood there
congeal’d.</p>

<p class='c013'>This <i>Musk-Animal</i> is common in the <i>East-Indies</i>, as in the
Kingdoms of <i>Boutan</i>, <i>Cochin China</i>, but the most esteem’d are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>those of <i>Tibet</i>. When the Bladder under the Belly is taken out,
they separate the congeal’d Blood, and dry it in the Sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir <i>John Chardin</i><a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c019'><sup>[243]</sup></a> says, <i>Musk</i> is also produced in <i>Persia</i> from
an Impostume in the Body of a Beast, that resembles a <i>Goat</i>, and
grows near the Navel, and is better than that of <i>China</i>. The
Scent of it, adds he, is so strong, that it many times kills those
who hunt the Beast, when they first open the Bag, except they
stop their Mouths and Noses with Linnen: ’Tis easily counterfeited,
and the best way to try it, is by drawing a <i>Thread</i>, dipt
in the Juice of Garlick, thro’ the <i>Bag</i> with a Needle; and if the
Garlick loses its Scent, the Musk is good. <i>Atl.</i> 397.</p>

Foot long, not quite so thick as a Man’s Arm, of an olive Colour,
yellow Belly, in Body round, cloath’d with Scales that make an
elegant Appearance in a sort of triangular form. ’Tis very venemous,
and its Wounds not curable without timely and proper
Applications.</p>

Feet in length. Several sorts of <i>Lizards</i> are mention’d in

<i>Lacerta</i>; the third is translated a <i>Mole</i>, but <i>Bochart</i> maintains, it

the Heads of Leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be Meat to the
People inhabiting the Wilderness</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I think of the superstitious <i>Egyptians</i> warring against
the People of <i>Tentyra</i>, I can’t but observe how the same kind of
Spirit (the more the pity) too often reigns among Christians:
Those who have ridicul’d Superstition, and endeavour’d to propagate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Truth, have always had Vengeance and Wrath breath’d
out against them, and have been exposed to the same Fate as the
<i>Tentyrians</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Habitations of Crocodiles are generally in great Rivers,
as the <i>Ganges</i> in <i>Asia</i>, one of the greatest Rivers in the World,
and which is accounted sacred: Its Water is clear and sweet,
weighs an Ounce in a Pint lighter than any other Water in the
Country: The <i>Great Mogul</i>’s Court drink none else with their
Wine. These monstrous Animals are also found in the <i>Nile</i> and
<i>Niger</i>, two of the greatest Rivers in <i>Africa</i>; and also in the great
Rivers of <i>America</i>, especially those of the <i>Amazons</i>, which abound
with Crocodiles of vast Bigness, that very much annoy the Inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>GEMELLI</i> in the <i>Atlas</i>, says the <i>Crocodile</i> is hatch’d of an
Egg no bigger than that of a Turkey, but grows to thirty Foot
long, the Back arm’d with impenetrable Scales, the Mouth wide
enough to swallow an Heifer, and only moves the upper Jaw;
it sees better by Water than Land, is cowardly, and generally
flies from those that attack it, but daring enough otherwise; for
which reason the <i>Egyptians</i> made it the Hieroglyphick of Impudence.—They
have no Tongue, and eat nothing in all the autumnal
Quarter<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c019'><sup>[249]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Animal has a great Dexterity in catching Wild-fowl,
which always abound in those great Rivers, and along Sea-shores,
as Ducks, Teals, and other Water-fowls: When in want of
Food, he goes into the Sea, where he lies in such a manner, that
the upper Part of his Back appears above the Water, and looks
like a piece of Timber floating; the wild Fowls mistrusting nothing,
come so near it, that he immediately devours them: They
lurk among Reeds and Bushes, on the Banks of Rivers and great
Pools, from whence they suddenly leap out, and eat up their
Prey, which sometimes happens to be People that come to drink
or fetch Water.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Inhabitants of <i>Madagascar</i>, an <i>African</i> Island, look upon
Crocodiles as Devils, and swear by them: When Differences
happen among them, they go to a River, where he that is to
swear throws himself into the Water, and conjures the Crocodiles
to be Arbitrators betwixt him and his Adversary, and to let him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>live if he speaks Truth, but if otherwise, to destroy him<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c019'><sup>[250]</sup></a>.

<p class='c013'>This Land Crocodile is indeed an amphibious Animal, lives
partly in the Water and partly upon dry Ground: It has four
slender Legs like a Lizard; its Snout is sharp, and its Tail short,
cover’d with small Scales of a silver Colour. ’Tis hatch’d in
<i>Egypt</i>, near the Red-Sea, in <i>Libya</i>, and the <i>Indies</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Leviticus</i> there’s mention made of a kind of <i>Crocodile</i>, in
the <i>Hebrew</i> called <i>Choled</i>, which the Septuagint translates
κροκοδειλος χερσαιος, a land Crocodile, which is a kind of Lizard,
that feeds upon the sweetest Flowers it can find; this makes its
Intrails to be very much valued for their agreeable Smell. <i>Bellonius</i>
says, it has four Feet, and a round knotty Tail, and is as
big as the <i>Salamander</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There’s scarce any way to manage him by Land, unless it be
by a Wile, as they do on the Bank of <i>Nilus</i>, where little Huts
are erected, from whence the Watchmen, upon the Approach of
a Crocodile, spring out with long Branches in their Hands, which
they, with great Dexterity, thrust into its Throat; and not being
able to extricate itself, it falls down, upon which others of them
discharge their Arrows at his Belly, which being a tender part, he
is soon killed; but in Water he is quickly noosed, because for want
of a Tongue, he can’t safely open his wide Mouth, without being
suffocated.</p>

<p class='c013'>This terrestrial Crocodile comes to us by way of <i>Alexandria</i>
and <i>Venice</i>, and is very useful in physical Prescriptions.</p>

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>LXXVII. The <i>Cordylus</i> is a little noxious Reptile, supposed
by some to be the <i>Land Crocodile</i>, because upon first sight it looks
like the <i>Nilotic</i>; but upon a stricter view, the Fallacy appears.
The Back is cover’d with close compacted Scales, as a House with
Tiles, by which ’tis distinguish’d.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its Tail is rough, and like a Club, wherewith it strikes whatever
it meets, therefore is called <i>Caudiverbera</i>, that is, one that
strikes with the Tail; a Tail prominent with War<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c019'><sup>[254]</sup></a>.</p>

to change its Seat, as the <i>Spaniards</i> their old Fashions and Customs.
This little Creeper is of the northern Tribe, being generally
found in the Mountains of cold Regions. It is observable,
that if its Head be comprest or squeezed, it will throw out drops
of Blood with a Force that will carry them several Yards off<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c019'><sup>[255]</sup></a>.</p>

in <i>Italy, &amp;c.</i> lives in Meadows, and being of the harmless kind,
little is said of it. There are many Lizards of other Colours, but
none so beautiful as the green ones; tho’ very small, they are
pretty: Many make themselves very familiar with them, and put
them in their Bosom<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c019'><sup>[256]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c033'>LXXX. The <i>Tejuguacu</i> is a <i>Brazilian Lizard</i>, of black Colour,
beautified with elegant white Spots, which renders it pleasing
to the Eye: Its Tongue is long and cloven, smooth and red.
’Tis a little Creature, and moves its little Body with great Celerity;
is patient in Want, and will for six or seven Moons, live
without any kind of Sustenance, but Air, the Fluid in which we
all breathe.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXI. The <i>Taraguira</i> is another <i>Brazilian</i>, of about a
Foot long, whose Body is smooth, and naturally guarded by an
Armour of a strong squamatick Skin, and the Scales situated in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>kind of triangular form: It affects to reside in Underwoods, and
Places inclosed, and near to Houses.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXII. The <i>Americina</i> Serpent, which is not much different
from the former, except it be in its forked Tail, which terminates
in two different Points; and in this Article seems to differ from
all other sanguineous Animals, among whom, says the learned
<i>Ray</i>, I have never heard of any else furnish’d with two Tails:
This looks like something anomalous in Nature, and contrary to
its common Rules, if the Description be true.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXIII. The <i>Taraquico Aycuraba</i> is another venemous Offspring
of <i>Brazil</i>, a Species of the former, but differs from it in
the Tail, which is single. This Animal is covered with little
rough triangulated Scales, the Extremity of which is decked with
brown Spots, and the Back with various dusky Specks, ranged in
the form of Waves.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXIV. The <i>Americina</i> is a little venemous Creeper,
whose Body inclines to the square, about three Fingers long, in
Crassitude as the Quill of a Swan; bright to the Eye, and smooth
to the Hand: The Back is made strong by whitish Scales; the
Head, Shanks, and Sides with brown ones: The Tail is of a fine
azure Colour; its Claws are setigerous, resembling the Bristles of
a Hog.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXV. <i>CARAPOBEBA</i> is another minim Serpent of
<i>America</i>, and veneniferous, four or five Fingers long: The Body,
that in Colour resembles a Liver, is adorn’d with white Marks,
(and the Tail with white Lines) and is illuminated with glaring
Eyes, like Globes of Glass.</p>
<p class='c033'>LXXXVI. <i>TEJUNHANA</i> is a little Serpent, whose Head
is sharp-pointed: The Tail is about six Fingers long, smooth and
round, and ends like a Needle; the Head is cover’d with rough
Scales, like <i>Milford</i> Oysters; the Back and Sides are cloath’d with
a Skin, that is finely painted with green and brown Colours, and
when touched, feels soft like Velvet.</p>
<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>LXXXVII. To these <i>Americans</i> I add the <i>Stellio</i>, which Mr.
<i>Ray</i> calls the <i>swift</i>, or <i>spotted Lizard</i>, whose Body makes a glorious
Appearance, by glittering Spots, that when it makes its Parade,
looks like a little moveable Firmament of Stars: This Serpent
is pretty common in <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, and <i>Syria</i><a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c019'><sup>[257]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>’Tis said of this Animal, that it casts its Skin and eats it again;

</div>

<p class='c033'>LXXXVIII. The <i>Les Anoles</i>, a Serpent in bigness like the
<i>Gallick</i> Lizards, but of a longer Head; of a yellow Skin, like a
Sun-burnt <i>Roussilonite</i>, or the <i>Savage Man</i> in the Isle of <i>Borneo</i>;
Russet Back, channel’d with green; of an ashy or cineraceous
Colour; a boisterous noisy Animal. It’s generally in motion by
Day, and by Night, lodges in hollow places, where it joins with
the Brotherhood, in disturbing the Neighbours with hideous
Croakings: by the loudness of its Noise, it should seem that it had
but an empty Noddle.</p>

<p class='c033'>LXXXIX. <i>LES ROQUET</i>, a Serpent of a ruddy Colour,
intermix’d with black and yellow Points: of sparkling Eyes, and
majestick Mien, walking in a stately manner with Head erect;
and skipping about like a Bird, or a <i>French Beau</i>, who was said
to make a <i>Solecism</i> with his Hand, when he made a false Gesture
on the Stage.</p>

<p class='c033'>XC. The <i>Maboujas</i>, a word that signifies a Devil in the <i>Indian</i>
Language, and given to this Serpent, because in its Nature
it is most malignant and mischievous: It lives in fenny Ground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and shaded Valleys, dreadful in Appearance, and more so in its
Executions.</p>

<p class='c013'>This cruel Serpent is an Emblem of the old Serpent, that
great fiery Dragon, that in a few Hours reduced <i>Job</i>, a wealthy
Prince, into the lowest Ebb of Poverty, converted his Palace into
a Dunghill, and his Body into an Hospital of Diseases; and if
permitted, he would immediately turn the Earth into a Scene of
Blood and Destruction; therefore he is called απολλυωνορ, the <i>Destroyer</i>,
<i>Rev.</i> ix. 11. the Murderer, and Shedder of Blood. <i>N. B.</i> The
tutelar Deity of the <i>Cæsars</i> was <i>Apollo</i>, that is, the—<i>Destroyer</i>.
The like kind of bloody Deity has presided in the Temples of Tyranny
ever since.</p>
<p class='c033'>XCI. The <i>Gobe Moujes</i>, so denominated by the <i>French</i>, from
its <i>gobbling</i> all kinds of Flies, which it constantly hunts, and swallows
in a voracious manner. It commonly frequents Houses
where it suffers no little Insects to live, no not upon Garments:
It is of the stellionick form, and the least of all the Quadrupeds
in those <i>Antilles</i>, which our <i>English</i> call, the <i>Leeward-Islands</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>May not this Animal serve to represent those gobbling Sots,
who brush off the Flies of Melancholy, and drown them in the
inchanted Cup? Thus likewise the Sons of <i>Mammon</i> hunt for
<i>golden Flies</i>, as Entertainments most delicious.</p>

<p class='c033'>XCII. <i>BROCHET DE TORRE</i>, or the <i>Land-Pike</i>, is a
Serpent of about fifteen Inches long, so termed from its Likeness
in Figure and Skin to that Fish. Instead of Fins, it has four
Feet, too weak to support the Body, therefore crawls on its
Belly, after an odd unusual manner, winding its Body about like
a Pike newly taken out of the Water; which kind of Motion being
strange, strikes Terror into Spectators. <i>Tetre</i> denies it to
have the perfect Shape, Head and Skin of the common Pike,
and treats <i>Sieur Rochefort</i> with some Roughness, according to
Mr. <i>Ray</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Night, these Serpents are found under the Rocks, where
they make a frightful Noise, more hideous than the croaking of
Frogs and Toads. In <i>Antigua</i> is a Fish called <i>Cane</i>, like our <i>Pike</i>
in figure, seven or eight Foot long, and big in proportion: It
preys like the <i>Shark</i>, and especially on human Flesh; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>least Bite of its Teeth proves mortal Poison, without immediate
Application of some sovereign Antidote<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c019'><sup>[260]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c033'>XCIII. The last he mentions, is a <i>little Serpent</i>, about seven
Fingers in length, and terrible to the Eye. The Skin is embroider’d
with black Scales, that look smooth and sleek as if it were
a Surface of Oil: It is furnish’d with very sharp Teeth, small
Eyes, but so weak that they can’t long face the Light, no more
than a <i>Frenchman</i> can look Truth in the face, or a <i>Spaniard</i> the
Field of Battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this little venemous Animal apprehends any Danger,
it immediately digs into the Earth, with its five crooked and
strong Claws, that soon penetrate the Ground: ’tis guilty not only
of Evils among Beasts, but of great Devastations in Orchards and
Gardens<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c019'><sup>[261]</sup></a>.</p>

but the most remarkable in this way, is the <i>Mole-Cricket</i><a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c019'><sup>[262]</sup></a>.
Swine, who dig in the Earth for their Food, have all parts of their

<p class='c033'>XCIV. The <i>Ground Rattle-Snake</i>, so called, only because it
resembles the real Rattle-Snake in Colour, but is somewhat darker:
It never grows above twelve or sixteen Inches long; ’tis reckon’d
among the worst of Snakes, and of a hardy Nature, because it
keeps out of its Winter-Quarters the longest of any. N. B. <i>This
Serpent and some of the following are taken out of the natural History
of</i> Carolina<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c019'><sup>[263]</sup></a>, a part of <i>America</i> belonging to <i>England</i>. The
Natives of that Country were of a larger Size than <i>Europeans</i>,
and accounted so faithful in their Promises, and so just in their
Dealings, that they had no Words to express <i>Dishonesty</i>, <i>Fraud</i>,
or <i>Cheating</i>,—What contributed chiefly to their honest Simplicity,
and plain Method of living, was their Contempt of Riches;
were content with plain Food and Raiment, without being anxiously
sollicitous for to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>XCV. The <i>Horn-Snake</i>, very venemous, hisses exactly like a
Goose, upon any body’s Approach. Serpents of this Class strike
at the Enemy with their Tail, which is arm’d at the end with a
horny Substance, like a Cock-Spur, that kills whatever is wounded
with it. ’Tis said, that in <i>Virginia</i>, they only shoot their Tongues,

various sorts, and all in some degree amphibious. When the
<i>Coluber Aquaticus</i> wounds any, ’tis attended with a most disagreeable
Odour, and so strong, that it forbids a near Approach to
the unhappy Sufferer, who immediately falls into a Tremor and
Distraction, and soon expires (the third day, says <i>Ælian</i>) without
timely Relief<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c019'><sup>[265]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its common Residence is in shallow Waters, and when they
are dried up, it goes upon dry Ground, where its Wound is
more dangerous than in Water: But more of this elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c033'>XCVII. In that Country they have what they call <i>Swamp-Snakes</i>;
three sorts of which are near a-kin to the Water-Snakes,
and may be rank’d among them. The Belly of the first is of the
carnation Colour, the Back is dark: the next, which is of a brown
Colour, always abides in the Marshes: the third is of a motley
Colour, and very poisonous.</p>

<p class='c013'>They dwell on the sides of Swamps, <i>i. e.</i> Bogs, Marshes,
and Ponds, have a prodigious large Mouth, and they arrive to
the thickness of the Calf of a Man’s Leg. Among these I place
the black <i>Truncheon-Snakes</i>, that live on the Banks of Rivers,
which, when disturbed, shoot into the Water, like an Arrow
out of a Bow. I fancy the Name is borrow’d from a certain
Weapon call’d Truncheon, which we call <i>Battoon</i>, or Tipstaff,
of a cylindrical form, used by principal Officers of State, Generals,
and sometimes by Constables, when they go upon secret
Expeditions.</p>

<p class='c033'>XCVIII. The <i>Red-belly-Snake</i>, this is so called from its ruddy
Colour, which inclines to an Orange-red. Of these are two sorts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>one, like <i>Abel</i> the Innocent; the other, like <i>Cain</i> the Cruel:
An Emblem of the World, humane, angelic Animal, and Vegetable,
in which is a Mixture of Good and Evil.</p>

<p class='c033'>XCIX. The <i>Red-back-Snake</i>, so named from that Colour;
a long, slender Snake, but not very common. A certain Surveyor
of Lands in <i>Carolina</i> happen’d to step over one of these, which
he did not see till his Servant spy’d it: The Surveyor inquired of
the <i>Indian</i> that was along with him, <i>Whether it was a very venemous
Serpent?</i> Who answer’d, <i>That if he had been wounded by

<p class='c013'>Red, which is one of the primary Colours, proceeding from
the least refrangible Rays of Light, is a lively Emblem of Fire,
or the fiery Venom in this Serpent, whose principal Quality is
to draw Blood.</p>

<p class='c033'>C. The <i>Scorpion-Lizard</i>; ’tis commonly called so, but is no
more like it than a Hedge-Hog: It is indeed of the Lizard Colour,
but much larger: Its Back of a dark copper Colour; the
Belly, in Orange; quick in its Motion on the Ground, and very
nimble in running up Trees; has several Rows of Teeth, and is
reckoned to be of a very poisonous Nature.</p>

<p class='c033'>CI. The <i>Long Black-Snake</i>, is a land Animal, and very common.
<i>I have</i>, says my Author, <i>kill’d several of them, full six
Foot in length</i>. Its Bite, tho’ painful in its Consequences, is not
deem’d commonly mortal: the wounded Part swells, and turns
to a running Ulcer. No living Creature more nimble in Motion,
or a greater Enemy to Mice, for it leaves not one of that Vermin
alive, wherever it comes. This Serpent kills the Rattle-Snake,
by twisting its Head about the Neck of that Snake, and whipping
her to death with its Tail.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Serpent very much haunts Dairy-houses in those Countries,
and makes very free with unguarded Milk-Pans, and Cream-Pots:
It delights to be among Hens, whose Eggs it does not suck,
but swallows them whole, as all Snakes do their Sustenance. It
will often swallow the Egg under a sitting Hen, and then lie in
the Nest in the form of a Ring.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Allow here a few Remarks upon the Nature of Milk and
Eggs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all kinds of Vegetables is an oily Substance, which is a Fluid
that Animals take in with their Food, and no vegetable Food is
nutrimental, without some Proportion of this Oil; even Grass,
especially in its Seed, abounds therewith, which being thoroughly
mixt with the <i>Saliva</i>, it turns <i>milky</i> in the Stomach: Which differs
from the <i>Chyle</i>, only as having been more concocted, and
containing a large degree of Salt, which renders it convertible into
Curd.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>MILK</i> therefore is an <i>oily vegetable Matter</i>, circulated first
in Plants, then in Animals, and capable of being reduced into a
caseous and watry Substance, (or Cheese and Whey, if you please.)
If <i>Milk</i> finds no opportunity of passing off in its own natural
form, it turns to <i>Fat</i>, or goes away by Urine and Sweat, which
commonly is the case in Men, for they generate Milk as well as
Women, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>An Egg is from a certain animal Liquid, which by repeated
Circulations in the Body, arrives at a perfect animal State; this
Fluid comes from the oviparous Class, which is the White wherein
the Yolk appears to swim. The White and Yolk of Eggs are
neither alkaline nor acid.</p>

<p class='c013'>The White dissolves by <i>a gentle Heat</i>, till it totally liquifies,
(thus the Hen’s Heat gradually dissolves the White of a prolific
Egg into Nourishment for the Chicken) but if you expose the White
to the <i>Heat of boiling Water</i>, it will immediately harden, into a
viscous, dry Mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The White of an Egg is a surprizing Menstruum, for if it
be first boiled hard in the Shell, and afterwards suspended in the
Air by a Thread, it will resolve and drop down into an insipid
Liquor; which is that heterogeneous Menstruum so much used
by <i>Paracelsus</i>, and will make a thorough <i>Solution of Myrrh</i>, which
is more than Water, Oils, or Fire itself can effect<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c019'><sup>[267]</sup></a>. <i>N. B.</i> The
White of an Egg, by a strong Distillation, will afford an alkaline
Spirit, and will putrify by Digestion; and a single Grain of this
putrify’d Substance taken, will, like Poison, presently cause a
Nausea, Vomit, Diarrhœa, Fever ... as <i>Bellini</i> tells us he has
tried. And the learned <i>Boerhaave</i> himself, had seen those terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Effects of it, which however are immediately stopt by drinking
any acid Liquor, as Vinegar, Juice of Lemons. From Milk
I proceed to give an account of an odd Custom about Cheese in
Antiquity, <i>viz.</i> Among the <i>Romans</i>, one of their <i>Tabernæ</i> was
called <i>Casearia</i>, <i>a Caseo i. e.</i> from Cheese; not because Cheese
was made or sold in it, but because it was wont to be smoaked
there: It being a Custom among the old <i>Romans</i> and other <i>Italians</i>,
to make a great Smoke with Reeds and green Wood, on
purpose to dry and colour their Cheese; hence the Poet <i>Martial</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>CII. The <i>King’s Snake</i>, is the longest of all others; but not
common. It is said to be terrible to other Serpents, though not
very venemous and gross: the <i>Indians</i>, Men and Women, in <i>Carolina</i>,
make <i>Girdles</i> and <i>Sashes of their Skins</i>, as Signs of Conquest,
and wear them as Trophies of Honour.</p>

<p class='c013'>This puts me in mind of <i>Hippocrates</i>, the Prince of Physicians,
who tells us that in the Eastern Parts of <i>Europe</i>, there is
a <i>Scythian People</i>, called <i>Sauromatæ</i>, bordering on the <i>Palus
Mæotis</i>, where the Women ride on Horse-back, draw the Bow,
throw the Javelin as they ride, and fight in their Battles, so long
as they remain Virgins; and were not allow’d to marry, <i>till they
had killed three Enemies in the Wars</i><a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c019'><sup>[268]</sup></a>. Of my Author ’tis said,

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> These were the Women called <i>Amazons</i>, descended
from the <i>Scythians</i>, whose Women were as warlike as the Men,
and joined with them in their Wars.</p>

<p class='c033'>CIII. The <i>Corn-Snake</i>, is most like the <i>Rattle-Snake</i> of all
others in Colour, but the Chequers are not so regular; neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>has it any Rattles. They are frequently found in <i>Corn-fields</i>, from
whence, I presume, they have their Appellation. In their Qualities
they resemble the <i>Green-Snakes</i>, that are innocent by Nature,
and in form admirably pretty, if I may be allow’d by the
Ladies, to call a Serpent so.</p>

<p class='c033'>CIV. The <i>Blowing-Serpent</i>, which is a Species of the Viper,
but larger than the <i>European</i>, is so called, because it seems to
blow, to spread its Head, and swell very much, before it bites;
which Bite is very poisonous, and seems to receive some additional
Malignity from the Enlargement of its Head beyond the common
Proportion.</p>

<p class='c033'>CV. The <i>Brimstone-Snake</i>, so denominated from the Similitude
of Colour: They might as well call it, the <i>Glass-Snake</i>,
for if any Credit be given to the Historian, ’tis as brittle as a
Glass-Tube, or a Tobacco-Pipe, so that upon the touch of a
Twig, it immediately breaks into several Pieces, which some say,
and nobody believes, are capable of Re-union.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its component Parts may be weak and frail, but it is questionable,
whether so brittle as represented: ’Tis true indeed there are
hard Bodies, that would not be affected with a Twig, yet are
very brittle. Thus <i>Iron</i>, which is one of the hardest Metals and
yet <i>most brittle</i>, and by fusing, it becomes harder and more brittle.
Now this great Brittleness of Iron, arises from the great
quantity of Sulphur-Brimstone intermixed with it. The abundance
of <i>Sulphur</i> in <i>Iron</i>, is apparent from the <i>Sparks</i> it emits
from under the Smith’s Hammer; those fiery Sparks being only
the Sulphur of the heated Iron, nothing of which is seen in any
other Metal<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c019'><sup>[270]</sup></a>. <i>N. B.</i> Roll-Brimstone sold in the Shops comes
from the native Sulphur, which <i>Helmont</i> always preferred to
that purified.</p>

<p class='c033'>CVI. The <i>Yellow-Snake</i> is in length about seven or eight
Foot; the Neck is small, rather less than its Body, which grows
bigger, till it be as big as one’s Wrist, and continues so large to
the <i>Anus</i>; from whence it diminishes by degrees to the Tail. Its
Head (which is not very large) is of a dark Colour, and so are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the Scales all over the Body, with some yellow Streaks here and
there. The Belly is all yellow, like Marygold, whose Flowers
are cordial.</p>

<p class='c013'>These Serpents are for the most part to be found in the
woody Mountains of <i>America</i>, coil’d up in the Paths, as Ropes
in a Ship: they are not hurtful, unless irritated; they feed on
Birds, Rats, <i>&amp;c.</i> which they swallow whole, and therefore Nature
has given them such a folded, rugous, inward Tunicle of the
Stomach, that it may extend, and receive things of large Dimensions.
Many of them have been killed with thirteen or fourteen
Rats in their Bellies<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c019'><sup>[271]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been observed, that the Heart of this Serpent was beating
an Hour after the Head was cut off, and that it would turn
and twist its Body strangely in its Dissection, for a long time after
the Bowels were out: The Lungs were very membranaceous, being
nothing but Blood-Vessels and Air-Bladders. So a very learned
Author. <i>ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c033'>CVII. The <i>Chicken-Snake</i>, so called because of its Executions
in the Poultry-yard, where it devours all Eggs, and lesser Birds
that come in its way. These Serpents are of a sooty Colour, and
will very readily roll themselves round a smooth-bark’d Pine-tree,
eighteen or twenty Foot high, where there is no manner of hold,
and there sun themselves, and sleep all the pleasurable part of the
Day, reserving the hours of Darkness for rambling<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c019'><sup>[272]</sup></a>. There is
no great matter of Poison in them. Here the Historian mentions
the <i>Eel-Snake</i>, improperly so called, I think, because it is nothing
but a <i>Leach</i>, that only sucks, and can’t sting nor bite, so as to do
any Damage.</p>

<p class='c033'>CVIII. The <i>Vectis</i>, whose Head, strictly speaking, is neither
round, flat, nor pointed, but looks like a Swelling on both sides,
one stretching transversly, like a Bar that guards a Door, or, if
you please, a <i>Bettee</i>, an Engine to break open Doors. Though
this Sense be not intended here, yet ’tis true, that <i>Serpents</i> do
make <i>forcible Entries</i>, but it is always with Teeth and Tail, by
which they often throw down the whole Fabrick, and drive out
the Inhabitant.</p>

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>CIX. The <i>Agnasen</i> Serpent, called the <i>Mother of Ants</i>,
because it lodges in their Apartments, and other warm Situations.
We read of <i>Ants</i> in the <i>East-Indies</i> that build their Houses above
Ground, and with the <i>finest Clay</i>, of which the People make
their <i>Idols</i>; their little Houses are like strong <i>Butts</i>, hollow within,
where they dwell, and breed in Nests like Honey-combs.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Butts</i> present to my view the <i>Bow and Arrows</i> in the

<p class='c033'>CXII. The Serpent <i>Otus</i> is one of the Plagues of <i>America</i>,
and very poisonous, there being but few hours distance between
the Wound it gives and Death. It is about an Inch thick, and
three Foot long, a little Head and whitish Belly, and may be farther
distinguish’d from others, by white and black Spots, and
three red Lines running across; slow in Motion, and fond of
Shade; found in <i>Cuba</i>, a famous Island, where the antient Inhabitants
went naked, tho’ they might have been cloath’d in Gold.
The Historian speaking of <i>Spanish Cruelty</i>, observes, that a certain
<i>Indian Prince</i> having fled to <i>Cuba</i> for Shelter, was taken by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and condemned by them to be burnt alive. When
they were tying him to the Stake, a <i>Priest</i> told him if he would

he must burn for ever in Hell. Upon this, the poor distressed

’tis about an Inch round, and four or five Foot long. The
vulgar Opinion is, that the whole Body is all over tinged with
Poison, the Tail excepted. Its Head is very large, and of an
octangular form, so far as the Eyes, from which it grows less
and less to the Mouth, which is oblong and flat, arm’d with six
Teeth in the upper Jaws, and six in the lower, besides lesser ones:
The Tongue is slender, and of a black Colour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its Wounds are terrible, allowing the Patient only about
twenty-four hours to live. No sooner is the Wound given, but
all parts of the Body begin to swell, and soon extend beyond
their due Proportion; that they are soon disabled from performing

<p class='c031'>In <i>Persia</i> there are very long slender Worms bred in the Legs
and other Parts of Men’s Bodies, six or seven Yards long. Those
who live upon the Red-Sea, and feed upon Locusts, are, in the
last Stage of Life, subject to a sort of Flying-Worms, like what
is called a Tyke, spread over all the Body, arising at first from a
Scab, by scratching of which they tear their Flesh. <i>Nieremberg.</i>
Some relate divers Examples of Worms taken out of the
Tongue, Gums, Nose, and other Parts by a Woman at <i>Leicester</i>,
which they were Eye-witnesses of. N. B. <i>Mr.</i> Dent <i>and Mr.</i>
Lewis, <i>in the</i> Philosoph. Trans. <i>in</i> Lowthorp<i>’s</i> Abridg. <i>where these

If it did not extend the Digression too far, I might add here,
That there are no Animals, as Sheep, Wolves, Goats, Deers,
Cows, Horses, Swine; yea, no Vegetables, as Trees, Herbs,
Plants, Flowers, but abound with Worms; and all these have
Worms peculiar to themselves. By the help of microscopical
Glasses, we may discover Legions of Worms in Vinegar, human
Blood, and other Liquids.</p>

<p class='c033'>CXV. The <i>Ecatotl</i>, <i>Anguis-Venti</i>, <i>Serpent-of-the-Wind</i>, and
very innocent, and perhaps the Name may be borrowed from a
gentle salutary Gale; it is about six Spans long, and two Inches in
Crassitude; the Eyes are black, Teeth small, the Belly bright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>like Silver. The Back and Sides illustrated with white Streaks,

<p class='c033'>CXVI. <i>DE Angue-Laqueo</i>, the Ensnaring-Serpent. In the
Province of <i>Vera-Pas</i>, west of the <i>Honduras</i>; they are much infected
with several Insects, as <i>Muskettoes</i>, <i>Fire-Flies</i>, and <i>Serpents</i>.
Among the last is one Serpent of great Bulk, and excels in Craftiness,
being very subtle and sharp in laying hold of its Prey. The
Method is surprizing; for it wraps up itself in the Form of a
Ginn, and so decoys the Game into the Snare: It bites like a Dog,
and is very mischievous, tho’ not of the venemous Order. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c033'>CXVII. The <i>stupid</i> Serpent, which they call <i>Canaucoatl</i>, in
Character is contradictious; for, as represented in History, ’tis
dull and in a manner destitute of Sensation, and yet a Creature
full of Vitality and Spirit; and indeed is only remarkable for its
Mettle. It is of the Tribe of Innocents, and very strong, and
fears no Assault. In Dimension, monstrous; for Thickness, equal
to a Man’s Body, and twice the Length. ’Tis said, some have
sat upon it, apprehending it to be only the Trunk of an old Tree.
Some other fabulous Things are reported of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It lives in the Shadow of Woods, often concealing itself under
Branches and Leaves of Trees, where it surprizes the Prey,
which, to speak with the Vulgar, it draws to him, by the Force
of its Breath, as a Loadstone does Iron. The Authors of the
<i>Atlas</i> mention a Serpent of this attractive Power in the <i>Philippine
Islands</i>; Birds and other Animals are drawn into the Trap
by the Charms of the Breath; yea, Partridges, Weasels——are
made to run into its devouring Jaws. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>If this Serpent be endued with this magnetic Property, it is a
<i>living Loadstone</i>, and more extensive in its Attractions than the
real one; for this draws all animal Bodies to it, whereas the real
Loadstone only attracts Iron. Attraction in the gross, is so complex
a thing, that it may solve a thousand different things alike.
This Creature is called <i>Ibitin</i> in <i>America</i>; and probably the same
with the following, though distinctly considered by the Historian.</p>

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>CXVIII. The Serpent <i>Bitin</i>, an Inhabitant of the Mountains
and Woods in the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> of great Bulk, and Length
about four Ells; and in Shape terrible to the Eye. The Head,
which resembles that of a Calf, grows large to the Eyes, which
sparkle with the bright and black, and are incircled with Rays
of Green; it has wide Jaws, armed with many sharp Teeth, among
which are four of the <i>canine</i> sort.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>CANINI Dentes</i>, that is <i>Dog’s-Teeth</i>, are two Teeth in each
Jaw, so called, because they end like those of a Dog in a sharp
Point, whose particular Office is to pierce the Aliments, therefore
are buried in their Sockets, by which they are more able to
resist all lateral Pressures, than the <i>Molares</i>, or the common
Grinders.</p>

<p class='c013'>This <i>Bitinian</i> Serpent hangs by the Tail on Trees, devouring
Men and Beasts that pass by, and come within its Reach, by
the dint of halituous Attraction, as the <i>stupid</i>, and some of the
<i>Philippine</i> Serpents are said to do; but if it be so, the Philosophy
of it is not yet accounted for.</p>

<p class='c033'>CXIX. The <i>Monoxillo</i>, or <i>Mucronated-Serpent</i>, so called because
its Termination is sharp-pointed. It has something of the
Fierce and Terrible in its Appearance, but is more dreadful in Aspect
than Nature; for its Wounds, though painful, are not mortal.
’Tis of the Lacertan Kind and Colour; the Tail long, and Legs
of small length; the Body about two Spans long, the Tongue
large and forked and of red Colour. ’Tis tedious in Motion; the
whole Compound is crustaceous, like Shell-Fishes, adorned with
white and yellow Spots, resembling little Pearls, or Seed of Grummel
or Gray-Mile.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> The Seed of Vegetables consists of an Embryo, in
which is contained the whole Plant in Miniature. A compleat
Oak is visible in an Acorn by a Microscope.</p>

<p class='c033'>CXX. The <i>Tapayaxin</i>, a little wonderful Serpent; some say
of the Lacertan Kind, others say of an orbicular Form, not above
four Inches Long. The Body is cartilaginous, or gristly, smooth
and solid. This kind of Coverture is harder than a Ligament,
and softer than a Bone, but is not covered over with any Membrane
to make it capable of Sensation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>It moves slowly, and recommends itself by Diversity of Colours:
when touched, the Body appears to be cold. Now, Bodies
are said to be cold or hot, as their Particles are in a greater or
lesser Motion, than those of the sensitory Organs. All Changes
in the created Globe, are the Effects of Motion, without which
all Bodies would become unactive Masses<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c019'><sup>[284]</sup></a>.</p>

when taken up by human Hands; called on that account,
the <i>Friend of Man</i>; that is, <i>he who is not against us, is for

his natural Disposition, for it is an Inhabitant of cold Regions.

the Lacertan Tribe: a very long Head (like the <i>Philippine</i> Queen)

only one from another in Magnitude, Colour, and Poison.
The lesser kind not so venemous as the larger. Some are green,

<p class='c034'>The reason was, because the <i>Lacedemonians</i> were wont to fight

with a Dart, a thing that may be done by any Woman.</p>
<p class='c013'>So in the vegetable World, there are <i>Cedars</i> and <i>Shrubs</i>. In

and differenced from others by a Medley of Spots, compounded
of white, black, yellow, and dun Colours. The Head is like

<p class='c013'>Its Wounds are deadly, and burn like Fire; hence the Name
it bears: Though fiery in Nature, is slow and winding in Motion,
and may be avoided by the Traveller, if he has Eyes and
Ears. Its usual Residence is in Mountains, and the higher Mountains
are, the greater the Cold, (because they only receive direct,
and but little of the reflected Rays of the Sun) yet are the Habitations
of fiery Animals.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Learned observe, there are Mountains a Mile and an half
high, to the tops of which, no Vapour, and consequently no Clouds,
can ever reach: And hence it is that in very high Mountains, as
the <i>Pico de Theide</i> in <i>Bohemia</i>, though the middle part be always
inverted with Snow, and the bottom scorched with intolerable
Heat; yet on the top you will find yourself in a pure, thin, serene

privileged with Exemption from venemous Creatures, and where

<p class='c033'>CXXIX. The <i>Rubetarian-Serpent</i> is a very noisy Animal, who
for its croaking Noise is resembled to a land Toad. It also engages
the Attention of the Eye, for it excels in Beauty: It’s known among
Country People by these two Characteristicks, <i>viz.</i> <i>Loud</i> and
<i>Pretty</i>. Here we see, what is an Offence to the Ear may be a
pleasing Entertainment to the Eye; thus the Five Senses agree to
differ in their several Perceptions, and to meet in several distinct
Apartments of the capital Temple, in the pacifick Empire. But
to return to the <i>beautiful Padalica</i> of the <i>Polonians</i>:</p>

<p class='c013'>It is said of this Serpent, that when it wounds any in the
Foot, the Remedy is to put the wounded part into the next Earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>that is inclined to the moist, for twenty-four hours. This seems
to differ from the <i>American Rubeta</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>CXXX. The <i>Serpent de Boa</i> is another of the monstrous
kind; called <i>Boa</i> from <i>Bos</i>, the <i>Latin</i> word for an Ox, which
it devours at once: The young ones, which grow to a great Bulk,
are nourished by sucking the Cow.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Emperor <i>Claudius</i>’s time, in one of them that was
killed, they found a Child that was whole. In <i>Calabria</i> are some
monstrous Animals, not unlike these, says the Historian; who
adds, that not many Years ago a certain Bishop speaks of a large
mischievous Serpent, that was shot near <i>St. Archangel</i>, whose

<p class='c033'>CXXXI. I Am informed by some Persons, who had it by Tradition
from ancient People, that formerly there was in this Country a
monstrous Serpent of four or five Yards long, and thicker than a
common Axle-tree of a Cart, and very mischievous, preying upon
Lambs, <i>&amp;c.</i> Its chief Residence was in a Wood, near <i>Pickopbank</i>,
a few Miles from <i>Blackburn</i>, in <i>Lancashire</i>, called <i>Ouse-Castle</i>,
wherein there is yet a little Spot of Ground, called <i>Griom’s-Ark</i>,
which is a deep Cavern, situated among Rocks, in a Wood,
from whence it was seen to come out, and bask itself on a sunny
Bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Picture of this Serpent is drawn with Wings, two Legs,
and Talons like an Eagle, which is seen in some ancient Houses,
(and particularly at <i>Clayton-hall</i>, near <i>Dunkin-hall</i>) by which it
appears to be very large and furious.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s said, one —— <i>Grimshaw</i> Esq; Proprietor of that Hall,
shot the Monster with Arrows, and had an Estate offer’d him for
that good Service done to his Country, which he generously refused,
and only desired he might have a Passage thro’ that Wood
to a Township he had on t’other side of it, which was granted,
the Title of which is to be found in old Writings. By another
hand I am informed, that it was supposed to be a <i>Griffin</i>, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>is a Bird of Prey, and of the Eagle kind, which, I take to be
the <i>Ossifrage</i> of <i>Moses</i>, and mentioned <i>Levit.</i> xi.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is also a fabulous <i>Griffin</i>, represented with four Legs,
Wings, and a Beak; the upper part like an Eagle, and the lower
a Lion. They conjecture it to watch over golden Mines and
hidden Treasures. This Bird was consecrated to the Sun, therefore
the Chariot of the Sun was represented as drawn by a Set of
<i>Griffins</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This <i>poetick Griffin</i> is frequently seen in antient Medals, and
is still bore in Coat-Armor. The antient and honourable Family
of the <i>Guillims</i> blazons it rampant, alledging any very fierce
Animal may be so blazon’d as well as a Lion. It is observable,
says my Author, that in the Front of <i>Clayton-hall</i> are two Figures
drawn in Plaister in the form of a Coat of Arms; on the right
side of the Escutcheon is a Figure with Wings, four Feet, and a
Tail twisted in the Form of a Serpent. The like Figure is drawn
in Plaister in several antient Houses in that Neighbourhood, which
go under the Name of the <i>Griffin’s Picture</i>, and the Sign is used
at Publick-houses: There is a Place in that Wood called the
<i>Griffin’s-Ark</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> This seems to carry some Probability with it, since
Eagles are voracious Creatures, and very destructive to Fawns and
Lambs, especially the black Eagle, which is of a lesser Size than
the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some of the <i>Scots Islands</i>, the Natives observe, that this
Eagle fixes its Talons between the Deer’s Horns, and beats its
Wings constantly about its Eyes; several other Eagles flying at
the same time on both sides, which puts the Deer upon a continual
Run, till it fall into a Pit, or down a Precipice, where it dies,
and so becomes a Prey to the Enemy<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c019'><sup>[304]</sup></a>.</p>

Serpents: There is one that is <i>yellow</i> with brown Spots, and
another with <i>brown</i> Spots; but that which is the most poisonous,
is the <i>black and white spotted</i>, three or four Foot long.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Remedies are such as these: The Natives cut off the
Head of the Serpent that gives the Wound, and apply it to the
Place as the best Remedy: Others, by the Application of new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Cheese, extract the Poison; and some make use of the Rump of

<p class='c033'>CXXXIII. <i>MARTINIUS</i> in his <i>Atlas</i> relates, that in the
Province of <i>Quangsi</i> in <i>China</i>, there are Serpents thirty Foot
long. The <i>Flora Sinensis</i> reports of the Serpent call’d <i>Geuto</i>, that
it devours whole Stags, but is not very venemous. ’Tis of an ash
Colour, from eighteen to twenty-four Foot long; will often seize
on a Man, by leaping from a Tree, and kill him, by its violent
windings about him.—The <i>Chinese</i> preserve his <i>Gall</i> to cure the
Diseases of the Eyes.—<i>Marcus Paulus Venetus</i> testifies the same
of the Serpents of <i>Carrajam</i>.—Some are in length ten Paces, in
thickness ten Palms, and able to swallow a Man. Are taken thus:
The Serpent in the Day lies in Caves of Mountains; in the Night
hunts for Prey, and then returns to its Cave, with the weight of
its Body, plowing deep the Earth, being sandy in the Track it
goes along: Here the Huntsmen fix strong Stakes pointed with
Iron, covered with Sand; and as the Serpent travels along, the
Spikes gore its Entrails, and are fasten’d therein, by which ’tis
kill’d; and the Huntsmen sell the <i>Gall</i> at a great Price for Medicine,
and the <i>Flesh</i> for Meat. These, continues he, may be
reckon’d among <i>Dragons</i>, but are without Poison: Instead of
Feet, they have Claws like those of a <i>Lion</i> or <i>Falcon</i>.—There are
other Serpents in <i>China</i> full of rank Poison, especially the <i>hairy-headed
Serpent</i>. So far <i>Martin</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> This Province of <i>Quamsi</i> or <i>Quangsi</i> is able to raise a
Million of fighting Men. It is not so much frequented as the
Province of <i>Quantung</i> or <i>Canton</i>, where they have two Harvests a
year. One says, there is a Mountain here with a Pool in it,
which makes a Noise like Thunder, if a Stone be cast into it,
and causes Showers from the Sky<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c019'><sup>[306]</sup></a>. Their Winter is warm, and

<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>CXXXIV. There is a kind of <i>Reptiles and Insects</i> (I don’t mean the

and of white Colour, found in <i>Lydia</i>, <i>Arabia</i>,—cased over with a
white colour’d Shell, which shines like a sparkling Margarite<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c019'><sup>[307]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall close this Part with an Experiment made by the
noble <i>Roman</i> before-mentioned, who (being sollicitous to take a
compleat View of a Serpent) after he had dissected one, preserved
the Flesh and Bones, and having, <i>secundum artem</i>, reduced them
to Ashes,—extracted <i>Aqua Fontana</i>,—whose Virtues were equal
to those drawn from the Ashes of other Animals, and of Plants.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this venemous Tribe, I shall annex a few Reptiles, in
whose Veins I find something of the Serpent’s Blood; and close
the variegated List with a large Account of the <i>Tarantula</i>, its
Wound, and Cure by Musick; then inquire into the Reasons of
that strange Operation; the Nature and Force of Sounds, not
only on the Animal Passions, but Inanimate Matter. I shall begin
with,</p>
<p class='c033'>I. The <i>Bee</i>, called the Honey-Fly, a little Animal that has
four Feet, which it carries close to the Belly, and not easily
separated: It has four Wings, small Teeth, and a long Tongue,
which usually it carries out of the Mouth. Its Sting cleaves to the
Belly, which, when it strikes, it parts with, and becomes uncapable
of wounding a second time; which, I think can’t be said
of any other Member of the stinging Race, unless it be the Wasp
and Hornet.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sting, in the Design of it, seems to be only a Weapon
of Defence; it looks like a Tube or Pipe, hollow, with a little
Bag of sharp penetrating Liquid (which is its Poison) joined to
the Extremity of it within the Body, which, in stinging, is injected
into the Wound thro’ the Tube; and tho’ venemous and
painful, is not strong enough to corrupt the Mass of Blood.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>One may, with the naked Eye, sometimes see this little Insect
discharge its Venom, in which, says the ingenious Dr. <i>Mead</i>,
by the help of a Glass, I can easily discover <i>a great Number of
minute Salts floating</i>. In <i>Brazil</i>, <i>Bees</i> are distinguish’d into twelve
kinds, among which are some that sting in a most furious and
fatal manner, called <i>Mateecas</i> by the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Ceylon</i> in the <i>East-Indies</i>, are several Bees, the largest are of
a brighter Colour than ours; they make their Combs on the Boughs
of Trees: At proper Seasons, the Inhabitants hold Torches under
them, till they drop down, which they carefully gather, boil and
eat, and are accounted excellent Food. In <i>Quatemala</i> are Bees and
Honey of a white Colour, and some without a Sting, says the
Historian<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c019'><sup>[308]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f308'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r308'>308</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Nierembergius</i>, p. 286.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c033'>II. To the <i>Bee</i>, I add the <i>Wasp</i>, which, as it is something
larger, makes a deeper Wound; it differs also from it in its Food,
which is Flesh and Carrion, when it can be got; whereas the Bee
regales itself with delicious Entertainments, and enriches its Family
with all the Glories of the vegetable Kingdom. From whence
is the Honey? I answer, That in Flowers is found a viscid sweet
Juice, and accordingly we see Children gather Cowslips, Honeysuckles,
and suck the Honey from them. The Bees visit all
Flowers within their Reach, and putting it in their Trunks, suck
out the Honey, with which they load their Stomachs, to be discharg’d,
and laid up in their Combs. Among the Antients, Honey
was taken for a Dew that fell on Flowers; but this is a mistake,
because the Bees only gather it after the Sun is up, when
there is no Dew left, or very little.</p>
<p class='c033'>III. The <i>Hornet</i> is yet more dangerous, and has been known
to pursue a Sparrow, and kill it, and then suck its Blood. The
Hornet and Wasp have strong Jaws tooth’d, by which they can
dig into Fruits, for Sustenance; yea, and into harder Substances,
for Quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>If you take a Bee, a Wasp, or Hornet, and gently squeeze
the Tail, so that you can see the Sting, you may perceive a Drop
of transparent Liquor at the very end of it; which if wiped off,
you shall soon see it renew’d, that Liquid passing down the Cavity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>into the end thereof: ’Tis said the Decoction of Hornets
dropt on the Skin, makes it swell.</p>

<p class='c033'>IV. I proceed to the <i>Spider</i>, another little venemous Insect,
whose forked Tongue or Sting, is very fine and sharp; by this he
pierces Flies—and at the same time, instils a poisonous Juice into
the Wound, by which the Prey being kill’d, it sucks out the
Moisture, and leaves nothing but a husky dry Carcass: Tradition
says, it poisons by spitting, or breathing, because it dare not approach
so near to a large Fly as to a little one; but keeps at some
distance, and uses a kind of shoving Motion, upon which the
Fly has done struggling.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are various sorts of these little strange Creatures,
whose Stings are hurtful, as the <i>Astorius</i>, (so called from its resemblance
to a Star) whose Wound produces Heaviness, and Relaxation
of the Nerves. The <i>Cæruleus</i>, or blue Spider, whose
Sting is attended with Vomiting and Pain at the Heart. The
<i>Lycos</i>, the least of the kind, that causes an <i>Asthma</i>, and Swelling
about the wounded Part. In the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, we
have a Table of thirty-three kinds of Spiders found in <i>England</i>,
by Dr. <i>Lister</i><a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c019'><sup>[309]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is something very curious and admirable in those long
Threads they make in the Air, during some part of Summer, especially
towards <i>September</i>, so much wonder’d at, in such Quantities
every where. The Method of Operation, I take to be as follows,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>All Spiders that spin in a Thread, are the Makers of those
Threads, most visible in the Autumn. In all the ways of weaving,
they still let down the Thread they make use of, and draw
it after them. Attending on one that wrought a Net, I saw it,
says a very nice Observer, suddenly in the Mid-work desist, and
turning his Tail into the Wind, to dart out a Thread, with the
Violence we see Water spout out of a Spring: This Thread taken
up by the Wind, was in a Moment emitted some Fathoms long,
still issuing out of his Belly; by and by the Spider leapt into the
Air, and the Thread mounted her up swiftly.—And I found the
Air fill’d with young and old, sailing on their Threads, and undoubtedly,
says the Relator, seizing Gnats and other Insects in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>their Passage; there being often manifest Signs of Slaughter, as
Legs, and Wings of Flies ... on these Lines, as in their Webs
below<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c019'><sup>[310]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Spiders have been observed to get to the Top of a Branch
or such like thing, where they exercise this darting of Threads
into the Air. After the first Flight, all the time of their sailing
on those Threads, they make Locks, still darting forth fresh Supplies
of Thread to sport and sail by. <i>N. B.</i> Those called Shepherds,
or long-legg’d Spiders, are no Spinners.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have seen Spiders, says the Learned Dr. <i>Hulse</i><a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c019'><sup>[311]</sup></a>, shoot their
Webs three Yards long before they begin to sail upon them. So
the Learned <i>Derham</i> observes, that with pleasure he had often
seen Spiders dart out their Webs, and sail away by the Help
thereof.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>V. The <i>Scolopendra</i> is a little venemous Worm, and amphibious.
When it wounds any, there follows a Blueness about the
affected Part, and an Itch over all the Body, like that caused by
Nettles. Its Weapons of Mischief are much the same with those
of the Spider, only larger; its Bite is very tormenting, and produces
not only pruriginous Pain in the Flesh, but very often
Distraction of Mind. These little Creatures make but a mean
Figure in the Rank of Animals, yet have been terrible in their

<p class='c033'>VII. The <i>Lacertus Facetanus</i>, or <i>Tarantula</i>, whose Bite gives
Name to a new Disease. Those who are wounded by it are denominated
<i>Tarantati</i>: It is a kind of an overgrown Spider, about
the Size of a common Acorn.</p>

<p class='c013'>It borrows its Name from <i>Tarentum</i> in <i>Apulia</i>, a City in the
Kingdom of <i>Naples</i>, built by a Band of <i>Lacedemonian Bastards</i>,
who having no Inheritance at home, were sent thither to seek their
Fortunes, where they built that Town, and made it the Capital
of <i>Magna Græcia</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This little Animal is furnish’d with eight Eyes, and eight
Legs: Its Skin is tender and soft, of various Colours, and always
hairy: ’Tis of the oviparous kind, and propagates its Species by
Eggs, and sometimes a hundred Eggs have been found in one
Female.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Opinion of some, ’tis not only an Inhabitant of <i>Apulia</i>,
but peculiar to that Province, a Situation that may be called, <i>A
Garden of Rarities</i>; Plenty of generous Wine, delicate Honey

Habitation, especially to old Persons, according to the Poet<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c019'><sup>[316]</sup></a>;

think to have read something like it in <i>Persia</i>, where there is an
Insect like a Spider, about two Inches round, which the <i>Holstein</i>
Ambassadors suppose to be the <i>Latin Stellio</i>, and the <i>Italian Tarantula</i>:
It lets its Poison fall like a Drop of Water, which causes
an insupportable Pain in that Part ... immediately causes a profound
Sleep, from which the Patient is not to be recovered, but
by crushing one of the same Creatures upon the Wound; or, if
this can’t be had, by pouring as much Milk down his Throat as
they can, and then put him on an Engine, which they turn
round with great Violence, till by that violent Agitation, his Stomach
discharges the Milk, which appears greenish, because of
the Poison. Those who are cured thus, have some Remnant of
the Pain once a Year, about the same Season<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c019'><sup>[317]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Dog-Days</i> denote certain Days before and after the Rising
of this Star, to whose Appearance the Antients ascrib’d terrible
Effects: the very first Day it appears, they say (but without Reason)
the Sea becomes boisterous and boils like a Cauldron, produces
Variety of Distempers, sours Wine, and Dogs grow mad....
The <i>Romans</i>, dreading the Indignation of this Star, sacrificed
a Dog every Year to it, (<i>viz.</i> at its first Appearance in our
Hemisphere) to appease its Rage against Mortals.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Winter, this <i>Italian</i> Spider lurks in Caverns, and solitary
Places; and if it happens to bite, hurts not: There it lives in a
drowsy Posture, and keeps <i>Lent</i> till Summer; when the whole
Tribe creeps out, and disperse themselves over that pleasant Land;
and Wo to the Body asleep, and bare Legs, in Corn-Fields.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those on the Plains are much to be feared, the Air being
hotter there than on the Mountains, where their Bite is not dangerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the Solar Rays not being so strong in those Heights: and
what is yet more surprizing, is, that if they wound any out of

<p class='c013'>Some grow pale, sick and faint, and die in a short time, unless
relieved by Musick, which alone, without the Help of Medicine,
performs the Cure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Wounded are as Men half dead, but at the first Sound
of a musical Instrument, though they are very weak, and seemingly
unable to stir, they begin by degrees to move their Hands
and Feet, till at last they get up, and then fall to dancing with
wonderful Vigour, for two or three Hours, their Strength and
Activity still encreasing. Some will continue the Dance, without
Intermission for six Hours; and when tired they are put to Bed,
and after they are sufficiently recruited by Rest, they are called
up again by the same Tune, and renew the Dance with great
Violence, the Musick still playing; and when the Patients grow
weary, they are put into Bed again, and kept warm to encourage
Perspiration. These Exercises being continued six or seven Days,
the Patient finds himself fatigued and unable to dance any longer,
which is the Characteristic of a Cure.</p>

<p class='c013'>They usually spend ten or twelve Hours a-day in this violent
Exercise, and continue it for three or four, or six Days; by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>time they are generally freed from all their Symptoms, tho’ not
always, says the learned <i>Baglivi</i>, who observes, that about the
same time next Year, the Distemper returns, and will prove fatal,
if not prevented by the same musical Application.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Apulia</i> is a <i>Scorpion</i>, whose Wounds are accompanied with
the same Effects as those produced by the <i>Tarantula</i>, and are only
curable by <i>Musick</i> and <i>Motion</i>. These <i>Apulian Scorpions</i>, are less
violent than those of <i>Africa</i>, but more virulent than those in
other Parts of <i>Italy</i>. I shall only offer two Remarks here.</p>

<p class='c013'>1. <i>THAT different Patients must be entertain’d with different
Tunes, according to the different Symptoms of the Disease</i>; in which the
great Art of curing them seems to consist. <i>e. g.</i> Some are roused
by a Pipe, others by a Timbrel: Some are roused by a Violin,
others by the Harp; and all must be entertain’d with different
Airs. The Musicians therefore make Trial before they can accommodate
the <i>Sound to the Venom</i>; which requires the most brisk
and lively Tunes, to produce a powerful Vibration in the Body;
and till this be done, the miserable Patients stand still, sighing
and sobbing. The Vibrations must be quick and frequent.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. <i>DURING the Time of Cure, the wounded People throw themselves
into a Variety of strange Forms</i>, and behave like Drunkards
and Madmen ... talking foolishly ... diverting themselves with
naked Swords, red Cloth, <i>&amp;c.</i> but the Sight of any Object that
appears black is terrible to them. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>To this Account of the <i>Tarantula</i>, I have (by way of Illustration)
added the Remarks of another learned Foreigner, who says....
The venemous Bite of the <i>Tarantula</i> is quickly follow’d with
a very acute Pain, and soon after, with Numbness, profound
Sadness, difficult Respiration: The Pulse grows weak, the Sight
disturbed; Persons lose their Knowledge, Sense, and Motion;
and if destitute of Help, they die.... The most effectual and
certain <i>Remedy</i> is <i>Musick</i>: When the Person becomes destitute of
Knowledge and Motion, a <i>Musician</i> tries a Variety of Airs:
Shou’d he hit on that whose Harmony is suited to the Patient,
he begins to move by successive Degrees, and keeps Time with
his Fingers, Arms, Legs, <i>&amp;c.</i> he raises himself, and dances about
six Hours without Intermission....</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Musick ceases, the sick Person gives over dancing,
and is put to Bed: The same Air brings him out of Bed for a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Dance, an Exercise that lasts six or seven Days.——<i>N. B.</i> Every
sick Person must have his particular and specific Tune, and always
one that is very sprightly and moving.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Poison of the <i>Tarantula</i>, adds he, thickens the Blood,
and stops several of its Passages; thence the Numbness: The
Blood being thick, furnishes but a small Quantity of animal Spirits,
their Canals are shrunk up in the Brain: The Nerves being
destitute of Spirits, relax; thence proceed the Inactivity, and Defect
of Knowledge and Motion: But the Vibrations of the quick
Airs which are play’d, agitate the Blood and the rest of the animal
Spirits, which are soon increased by the Agitation of the
Blood: Being agitated and multiply’d, they run into the Fibres
and Nerves, which being put into <i>Unison</i> with the sonorous Strings,
receive their Vibrations, and are shorten’d or extended successively;
whence proceeds the successive Motion of the Fingers, Arms,
Legs, <i>&amp;c.</i><a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c019'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

Physic</i>, vol. ii. <i>Conversation</i> xiv. p. 268, -9.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The action of Dancing augments the Agitation of the Blood,
and makes the Patient sweat. The Poison being agitated and attenuated,
is exhaled by Transpiration; in proportion as the Poison
is exhaled, the sick Person perceives himself eased; this Ease
continually inclines him to dance: When all the Poison is dissipated
by Agitation and Sweat, the Blood recovers its Fluidity
and usual Course.</p>

<p class='c013'>I Shall conclude this historical Account, with a Passage
taken out of a <i>formed History of the Tarantula</i><a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c019'><sup>[321]</sup></a>, writ by a learned
Author, who having described the Disease, proceeds to the manner
of Cure, <i>viz.</i> The salivous Poison of that Spider seizes principally
on the Nerves and Muscles––the manner of Cure thus––</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Air moved by the musical Motion of Instruments, moves
the next, and so onwards (as we see in the circular increasing
Motion of the Water, when a Stone is cast into it) till the like
be produced in the Spirits of the Body, to which the Air is impelled.––Now,
adds he, the Commotion of the Passions depends
upon the Spirits, and the viscous Humour of the <i>Tarantula</i> is a
very capable Subject of Sound: Hence the next Air being moved
by a musical Tone suitable to the Patient, the lurking Poison, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Spirits of a Man are put into a Commotion; by which Agitation,
the Nerves being vellicated, the Spirits vehemently stirred, and
Muscles moved, the Dancing, or something like it, must of necessity
ensue, by which the Cure is performed: For, by vehement
Motion the Blood is heated, the Pores are opened, and the
Poison rarified; which can’t be done by common Sudorificks,
because the Medicines can’t reach, or at least can’t stir those little
Particles where the Poison lies, as Motion by Dancing does.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall add here some <i>Reflections on the Power of Musick,
and give Instances of it in the human Mind, in animal, and inanimate
Bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>MUSICK</i> appears to be one of the most antient of Arts, and
of all other, vocal Musick must have been the first kind, and borrowed
from the various natural Strains of Birds<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c019'><sup>[322]</sup></a>; as stringed Instruments
were from Winds whistling in hollow Reeds, and pulsatile
Instruments (as Drums and Cymbals) from the hollow Noise
of concave Bodies. This is the Conjecture.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c031'>Musick has ever been in the highest Esteem in all Ages, and
among all People. Nor could Authors express their Opinions of
it strongly enough, but by inculcating, that it was in Heaven,
and was one of the principal Entertainments of the Blessed.
The Effects ascribed to Musick by the Antients, almost amount
to Miracles; by means thereof Diseases are said to have
been cured, Unchastity corrected, Seditions quelled, Passions raised
and calmed, and even Madness occasioned.——</p>

<p class='c013'>Musick has been used as a Sermon of Morality.... <i>Athenæus</i>
tells us, that the Lives and Actions of illustrious Men were
written in Verse, and publickly sung by a <i>Chorus</i>, to the Sound
of Instruments, which was found to be the most effectual means
to impress Morality, and a right Sense of Duty on the human
Mind<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c019'><sup>[323]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Thus the <i>Pythagoreans</i> made use of Musick to cultivate the
Mind, and settle in it a passionate Love of Virtue. <i>Pythagoras</i>
instituted a most profitable Correction of Manners by Musick,
which, he says, conduces very much to Health; and he made use
of it, not only against Diseases of the Mind, but those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Body. It was the common Custom of the <i>Pythagoreans</i> to soften
their Minds with Musick before they went to sleep; and also in
the Morning, to excite themselves to the Business of the Day<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c019'><sup>[324]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>This Cure of Distempers by Musick sounds odd, but was a
celebrated Medicine among the Antients. We have already considered,
how those wounded by the <i>Tarantula</i> were healed by
Musick; the Evidence of which is too strong to be overturned:
That which now lies before me, is, to prove this to be the Practice
of Antiquity, which will appear by the following Instances.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall begin with <i>Democritus</i> (a Philosopher of the first
Rank, and a most diligent Inquirer into the Mysteries of Nature)
who taught in his Works, that <i>Musick of Pipes</i> was a Medicine
for most Distempers.... <i>Thales</i> of <i>Crete</i>, being sent for by the
<i>Lacedemonians</i> to remove the Plague, came, and by the Help of
Musick he did so; and he is said to do it by the Command of
<i>Apollo</i>, as appears from the Great <i>Chæronean Moralist</i><a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c019'><sup>[325]</sup></a>. If any
Credit be given to <i>Terpander</i>, it appears he supprest an Insurrection
in their Town by the Use of Musick. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f325'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r325'>325</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Plutarch</i>’s <i>Morals on Musick</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>We read of a young Man among others of <i>Tautomenium</i>, whose
Passions being inflamed by Musick in the <i>Phrygian Mood</i>, was
going to force open a Matron’s House, but his Rage was soon
calmed, when the Piper (by <i>Pythagoras</i>’s Advice) changed his
Air into the <i>Spondaic Mood</i>; and he went home quietly, which
the Philosopher could not make him do by Persuasives. This
historical Passage is confirmed by <i>Ammonius</i>, and <i>Cicero</i>, and is
thus related, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>When as some young Men, being drunk, and irritated by
the <i>Musick of Flutes</i>, would have broke into an honest Woman’s
House, but upon hearing one playing a <i>Spondaic Air</i>, their outragious
Heat was allay’d by the Slowness of the Mood, and Solemness
of the Tune....</p>

<p class='c013'>St. <i>Basil</i> gives another Instance to the same purpose, <i>viz.</i> That
<i>Pythagoras</i> meeting with some that came with Musick from a
Feast, drunk, requested the Musician to change his Tune; which
he did, and playing a <i>Doric Air</i>, they were so brought to themselves,
that they threw away their Garlands, and walked home,
ashamed of their Folly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span><i>THEOPHRASTUS</i> is said to cure Persons that had been
wounded by Serpents, with various kinds of Musick—<i>Probatum

and mitigated by Musick. <i>Plato</i> forbids Musick and Wine to

<p class='c013'>The <i>Pythagoreans</i>, to appease the Troubles of the Mind,
lulled themselves asleep by Tunes upon the Harp: Thus <i>Homer</i>
brings in <i>Achilles</i> relieving his Melancholy by playing on his <i>Lute</i>,
and mitigating his Anger against <i>Agamemnon</i> by Musick, which
he had learned of <i>Chiron</i>. <i>Asclepiades</i>, a <i>Roman</i> Physician of
great Reputation, is said to heal frantic Melancholy, and mad
People, by vocal and instrumental Musick<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c019'><sup>[328]</sup></a>. The learned <i>Neapolitan</i>

<p class='c013'>Whatever be the Cause of it, there is nothing more powerful
than Musick for moving the human Passions, making some
pensive and melancholy, others brisk and lively. The truth is,
says the Learned <i>Wallis</i>, we can match most of the antient Stories
of this kind in the modern Histories. <i>e. g.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>If <i>Timotheus</i> could excite <i>Alexander</i>’s Fury with the <i>Phrygian
Mood</i>, and sooth him into Indolence with the <i>Lydian</i>, a more
modern Musician is said to have driven <i>Eric</i> King of <i>Denmark</i>,
into such a Rage, as to kill his best Servants. The Occasion was
thus—The King willing to make Trial in his own Person, <i>whether
a Musician spoke true, who boasted, that by virtue of his Musick,
he could make People mad</i>: The Artist play’d, and the King
became outragious, and experienced the Truth of it so thoroughly,
that in the Excess of his Rage, he kill’d some of his best Friends<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c019'><sup>[329]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This may be owing to the Impression made by the Vibrations
of the Air, being carried as far as the Origin of the Nerves,
passes into the Soul, and puts the animal Spirits into a rapid Motion,
determines them to run into different Nerves, diffused thro’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>different Parts of the Body, and is communicated to those Nerves,
according as it finds them more or less in <i>Unison</i>.... Hence the
Passions and Madness itself. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>In Musick are different Tastes, which seems to proceed from
the different Constitutions of the Fibres or the animal Spirits: The
Fibres of the auditory Nerves are differently disposed in different
Persons, and in the same Person at diverse Times; but generally
speaking, Musick inspires more pleasing Sentiments, <i>e. g.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>A certain famous <i>French Physician</i> being ill, fell into a
violent <i>Delirium</i>, after some Days Illness of a continued Fever:
the third Day of his <i>Delirium</i>, I know not by what Instinct,
(says the Learned Father <i>Regnault</i>) made him desire a <i>Concert of

<i>M. Bernier</i><a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c019'><sup>[330]</sup></a>: Scarcely had he heard the first Notes, but his Eyes
were calm; a Serenity was spread all over his Countenance, the
Convulsions ceased, and he wept thro’ Excess of Pleasure; he was
free from his Fever all the time of the Concert, but whenever they
ceased singing, he relapsed into his former Condition: They fail’d
not to continue so marvellous a Remedy, which always suspended
his Indisposition. In short, after ten Days musical Entertainment,
he was restored to his former Health. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Another Instance, is a Dancing-Master of <i>Alais</i> in <i>France</i>,
who had the same Fate in the Year 1708; after a Fever of about
four Days, and a long Lethargy, he fell into a <i>Delirium</i>, both
mad and dumb. One of his Friends took his Violin, and plaid to
him those Airs he was most accustom’d to: People thought at first,
<i>that the Player was as mad as the Patient</i>; but, in a short time,
the sick Man raised himself upright in his Bed, with the Air of
a Man agreeably surpriz’d.... All his Motions discover’d the
Pleasure he felt: Soon after he fell into a deep Sleep, and the
Crisis he had during his Sleep, perfected his Cure. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>One Reason of this strange Operation might be this, <i>viz.</i>
The Sound of the Instrument agitates the Fibres, especially those
that are in Unison, by that means brings to his Remembrance agreeable
Perceptions ... sets the animal Spirits going, and restores
them to their natural Course: These Spirits being moved, run into
the Nerves and Muscles, where they have been used to run,
in order to form the Motion of certain Airs; the Passages of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Blood thereby become more free: Hence that serene Air diffused
all of a sudden over the Face of the sick Musician, who was
cured by the Charms of his own Art.</p>

<p class='c013'>These two Instances are quoted by the Learned Dr. <i>Nieuwentyt</i>,
who says, both of them (the Musician and Dancing-Master)
were perfectly restored to their Senses by Musick. He
also observes, that the Wound given by the <i>Tarantula</i> can only
be cured by the Sound of Musick, of which different Airs and
Tunes must be play’d, according to the different Nature and Colour
of those <i>Tarantula’s</i> that have given the Wound<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c019'><sup>[331]</sup></a>. Then

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>That the famous <i>Italian</i> Musician, <i>Angelo Vitali</i> had related
to him the following Story, and assured him of the Truth of
it, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>That a certain Player on the Flute at <i>Venice</i> had boasted,
that by his playing, he could deprive the Hearers of the Use of
their Understanding: Whereupon he was sent for by the <i>Doge</i>,
who was a Lover of Musick, and commanded to put his Art in
practice before him; where, after having play’d some time very
finely, (and to the Amazement of the Hearers) he at last begun
a mournful Tune, with a Design, as far as he was able, to put
the <i>Doge</i> into a melancholy Humour; and presently, he struck
up a jovial one, to dispose him to Mirth and Dancing; and after
having repeated these two kind of Tunes several times by turns,
the <i>Doge</i> being no longer able to endure those different Emotions,
which he felt in his Soul, he was ordered to forbear playing any
longer. <i>Ibid.</i> p. 271.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>FROM the Account given of Concords and Discords in Musick,
a Reason may be form’d why two Strings of a Viol, that are
Unisons or Octaves one to another, if one be struck the other will
tremble, so as to be visibly perceived.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>What is this Unison?</i> In Musick, <i>Unison</i> is a Consonance of
two Sounds, produced by two Strings, or other Bodies of the same
Matter, Length, Thickness, and Tension, equally struck, and
at the same Time, so that they yield the same Tone or Note.
Others define it, <i>the Union of two Sounds</i>, so like each other, that
the Ear perceiving no Difference, receives them as one and the
same Sound.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>What constitutes Unisonance, is the Equality of the Number
of Vibrations: Unison is the first and greatest of Concords.
Others say, it is only that in Sounds which Unity is in Numbers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Being once in a Room where there was a <i>Bass-Viol</i>, and
striking one of the Strings, a loose Quarry of Glass in the
Window, jarr’d every time that String was struck, which it wou’d
not do upon striking any of the other discordant Strings. The
Reason may be, <i>viz.</i> That the times of the Vibration of the
loose Quarry, were equal or near Concordance to those of the
String. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, when he sounded a
particular Tone on the Bass-Viol, very plainly heard the Noise
of the Glass of the Clock in his Chamber, which Glass never
moved, upon his sounding any other Tone.... It is a general
Remark, that an <i>Unison-String</i> will receive the Motion, and so
tremble, when another Unison is made to sound; and yet all other
Strings of the same Instrument, that are not Unisons, shall remain
silent and unmoved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Musick does not only exert its Force on the Passions and
Affections, and musical Instruments, but on the Parts of the human
Body also. Witness the <i>Gascoigne-Knight</i>, (mention’d by
Mr. <i>Boyle</i>) who could not contain his Water, at the playing of
a Bag-pipe: The Woman, mention’d by the same Author, who
would burst out in Tears, at the hearing of a certain Tune, with
which other People were but little affected: And in this County,
near <i>Rochdale</i>, there is a certain Man, who can’t forbear dancing,
if in a House, or Market, upon hearing a certain Tune sung.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wonder not at the strange Effects of musical Sounds, when
other Sounds strangely affect the Mind. How are the Passions
excited by the Sound of a Drum and the Discharge of Canons....
Not only human Minds and Bodies are affected by the Impression
of Sounds, but even Things without Life.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>KIRCHER</i> tells us of a large Stone that would tremble at
the Sound of one particular Organ-Pipe. <i>Mersenne</i> also tells us,
of a particular part of a Pavement that would shake and tremble,
as if the Earth would open, when the Organs play’d. Mr. <i>Boyle</i>
adds, that Seats will tremble at the Sound of Organs, that he has
felt his Hat do so under his Hand, at certain Notes, both of
Organs and Discourse; and that he was well inform’d, every well-built
Vault, would answer some determinate Note.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>We may observe the like mechanic Perception in several
empty Drinking-Glasses, of fine white Metal. Thus if we cause
the Strings of a musical Instrument to be stretched to a certain
Tone or Note, it would make one of the Glasses ring, and not the
other; nor would the Sound of the same String, tuned to another,
sensibly affect the same Glass. <i>Morhoff</i> mentions one <i>Petter</i>, a
<i>Dutchman</i>, who could break Rummer-Glasses with the Tone of
his Voice. The same, I think, is said of <i>Purcel</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When two Viols are tuned in Unison, one of them being
touch’d, the other will answer, tho’ at some distance. This is a
noble Proof of an harmonious Creation: This Unison looks like
a more pure sort of sympathising that is found in all the Creatures,
when those of the same Species flock together.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here give me leave to observe, that all Nature is as it were
a System of divine Musick, and delightful Harmony; or, in the
sacred Language, a <i>Poem</i> which is a Work of Skill, curious and
polite, lofty and sublime; in which Numbers and Measures are
exactly observed. Under this Idea of a <i>Poem</i> the old and new
Creation are represented.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>THE invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made</i>, τοις ποιημασι<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c019'><sup>[332]</sup></a>,
Poems that are made. The Creation is, as it were, a <i>Poem</i> in
the Sublime: Every Species of created Beings is a <i>Stanza</i>, and
every individual Creature, a Verse in it, as a certain learned Divine
expresses it. Creation here is not stiled εργον, which is a
Work of manual Labor, but ποιημα<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c019'><sup>[333]</sup></a>, a Work of Skill; not so
much the Operation of the Hand, as of the Head and Heart:
No Creature so small and mean, but glitters with a Beam of divine
Skill.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for the several Moods, which, in musical Composition,
were observed by the Antients, for moving particular Passions,
there is a remarkable Fragment of <i>Damon</i> the Musician, mentioned
by <i>Aristides</i> in <i>Plutarch</i>. This is supposed to be that kind
of Musick used by <i>David</i> and <i>Elisha</i>, as a Prescription to remove
mental Disorders; and may suppose to point at the Original of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the Pagans curing Diseases of the Body and Mind by instrumental
Musick.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s said, when an <i>evil Spirit</i> from God was upon <i>Saul</i>,
<i>David took a Harp and play’d with his Hand, so Saul was refreshed,
and was well, and the evil Spirit departed from him</i>.
1 Sam. xvi. 23.</p>

<p class='c013'>... <i>AND Elisha said to Jehoram, King of Israel.... Were it
not that I regard the Presence of the King of Judah, I would not look
towards thee, but now bring me a Minstrel. And it came to pass
when the Minstrel play’d, that the Hand of the Lord came upon him.</i>
2 Kings iii. 13,-15.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is observable here, that the Mind of <i>Elisha</i> the Prophet
was very much ruffled; now, under this Discomposure, he calls
for a Minstrel, not out of Levity, but for a religious End; and
that was, to compose his Mind, and to bring it into a serene and
sedate Frame, and thereby to prepare himself for divine Exercises;
or perhaps, a <i>devout Levite</i>, well skill’d in musical Performances,
might play before him, and intermix with it, Psalms
and spiritual Songs, according to the Constitutions of those
Times.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the Prophets might indispose themselves for the Spirit of
Prophecy, so they were to use Means to dispose themselves for
the Impulses of the Holy Spirit; and for this End the School of
the Prophets was appointed, in which the Students were trained
up <i>in the Science of Musick</i>, <i>in strict Virtue</i>, <i>Self-denial</i>, <i>Contempt
of worldly Grandeur</i>, <i>Knowledge of the Law</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> These Schools
were Seminaries of Religion, in which the intended Guardians of
the Spirituality were instructed, and prepared to receive the extraordinary
Gifts of the Spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>We read how the Indians performed their Worship by dancing
to Songs, the Priests of <i>Cybele</i> with <i>Cymbals</i>, the <i>Curetes</i> with
Drums and Trumpets, the <i>Romans</i> sung <i>Spondaic Verses</i>, while
they offer’d their Sacrifices; the musical Sound that calm’d the
Passions (consisting of <i>Spondees</i> principally) <i>Aristotle</i> calls moral;
(to distinguish it from the <i>Diatonic</i> and <i>Phrygian</i>) from whence
the Custom might be derived. When the <i>Spartans</i> went to War,
they march’d to the Sound of <i>Flutes</i>, to animate the Soldiers;
as is now done by Drum and Trumpet, to lessen the Terror of
Death.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><i>THE Antients having related wonderful Things done by Musick
in their days, by which Diseases were suspended, the Sick restored ...
I shall make a short Inquiry into the Reasons of it. Tho’ the Report
be strange, and in some degree hyperbolical, yet some Account
may be given of the surprizing Effects of Musick</i>, and is attempted
by the learned Dr. <i>Willis</i>, (among others;) a Hint of which I
shall add here, to what was observed before upon the Subject.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div><i>REASONS</i> (or rather <span class='sc'>Conjectures</span>) <i>for Medicinal Cures</i></div>
    <div><i>by MUSICK</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I. That Musick, if not new, was in those Days a rare
thing, which the Vulgar, on whom ’tis reported to
have mighty Effects, had scarce heard any before, and on whom
a little Musick will do great Feats, as we now find a <i>Bag-pipe</i> at
a <i>Morris-Dance</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. Antient Musick was much more simple and plain than
ours now, having only one single Voice or Instrument apart,
which to a rude Ear is much more taking, than compound Musick;
the former not exceeding their Capacity, whereas a Concert
of Musick confounds them quite, and ’tis by no means distinguishable
by them, so as to affect them with the Harmony of its
Parts.</p>
<p class='c033'>III. Musick, with the Antients, was of a much larger Extent
than what we now call by that Name; for Poetry, and
Dancing or graceful Motion, were then counted part of Musick,
when it had arrived to some degree of Perfection: And we see
that <i>Verse</i> alone, if in good Measure and <i>moving Words</i>, sung by
an agreeable Voice, with soft instrumental Musick, will work
strangely on the Ear, and move all Affections suitable to the Tune
and Ditty ... especially if attended with <i>proper Gestures and Actions</i>....
Thus suitable Acting on the Stage, gives great Life to
the Words<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c019'><sup>[334]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f334'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r334'>334</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Lowthorp’s Abridg.</i> vol. i. p. 618.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>If a deliberate pathetick Reading of a well-penn’d Romance,
will strike the Passions, and produce Mirth, Tears, Joy, Grief,
Pity, Wrath, Indignation, suitable to the respective Intents of it;
much more would it so do, if accompanied with all those Attendants.——</p>

<p class='c013'>If it be ask’d, <i>Why may not all this be done now?</i> I answer,
No doubt but it may, if the Address be made in proper Words,
emphatically spoken, with agreeable Voice, attended with a decent
Gesture; and all these adjusted to the Passion and Temper of
the Mind, particularly design’d to be produced, (be it Joy, Grief,
Pity, Courage, Indignation) will certainly now, as well as then,
produce great Effects upon the Mind, especially upon a Surprize,
and where Persons are not otherwise pre-engaged. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The Antients had the Art of exciting this or that particular
Passion of the Mind, the Tunes being suitably adapted to such
Designs; whereas those now are almost quite neglected in our modern
Musick.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Chromatick Genus</i><a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c019'><sup>[335]</sup></a>, with its greater and lesser <i>Semi-Tones</i>,
either ascending or descending, is very proper for the Pathetick
in Musick; as is also an artful Management of Discords,
with a Variety of Motions; now brisk, now languishing; now
swift, now slow. The <i>Venetian</i> Musician before-mentioned,
excell’d in the <i>Pathetick</i> to that degree, that he was able to play
any of his Auditors into <i>Distraction</i>.... The great Means he made
use of, was the <i>Variety of Motions</i>.——</p>
<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f335'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r335'>335</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Chroma</i> in Musick, is the graceful way of Singing.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Even little Children, when crying, are charm’d and quieted
by a jingling Sound, a Shadow of Musick. In short, Musick attends
the Man to his Grave, where Elegies were formerly sung in
Honour of the Deceased: Thus the <i>Phenicians</i> added <i>Flutes</i> to
their <i>Mournings</i>, and the <i>Romans</i> had their <i>Siticines</i>, that is, those
who sung to a Pipe, or blow’d the Trumpet at their Funerals,
a Custom not yet entirely abolish’d among the antient <i>Britons</i> and
some Parts of <i>England</i>, who, when they take up the Corps, sing
Psalms before it all the way to Church; a common Practice
about seventy Years ago: So far I can charge my Memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are not without modern Instances of Persons extraordinarily
affected by the Powers of Musick, as appears from our Opera’s,
and the very particular Devotion paid to the <i>Farinello’s</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the Age, and to <i>Italian</i> Musick, display’d in Temples as well as
on the Stage, the first Erection of which was intended for the
Honour and Defence of Virtue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Laconians</i> were wont at the Death of their King to tinkle
a Caldron, instead of a Bell: Yea, the <i>Jews</i> had their Minstrels
at Funerals; for, at the raising to Life the Daughter of <i>Jairus</i>,
’tis said, the <i>Musicians</i> were commanded to troop off, <i>Matth.</i> ix.
Before the <i>Roman</i> Funerals, a Trumpeter went, follow’d by the
<i>Præficæ</i>, <i>i. e.</i> old Women, singing Songs in Praise of the Deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus we have had a general View of Serpents, their Poison
and Cure; and a particular Account of Persons wounded by the
<i>Tarantula</i>, and cured by Musick; the Effects of which musical
Operation, have past for Miracles; for, by means of it, dangerous
Distempers have been cured, Insurrections quelled, Passions calm’d
and raised, even to Distraction and Madness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Antiently all Laws, Exhortations to Knowledge and
Virtue, and Lives of illustrious Men, were written in Verse, and
publickly sung by a <i>Chorus</i> to the Sound of musical Instruments,
which was found a most effectual way to impress Morality. So
much for Serpents in particular.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> In the Description of some Serpents by different Authors,
’tis difficult to know whether they mean the same, or another;
some having the same Description with different Names,
and some different Description with the same Name. Another
Mistake may arise from some Difference in the same Serpent, in
different Climates, as in Situation (<i>N.</i> or <i>S.</i>) and Size.</p>

<p class='c033'>The Manner of Sin’s first Entrance into our World, is inscrutable:
The Subject is an Article of Lamentation, an
Article that conducts us to Paradise indeed, but ’tis to <i>Paradise
lost</i>; whence date the <i>fatal Æra</i> of all human Calamities. There,
there in a blissful Field; Sin, the Plague of Hell, made its first
Appearance on Earth: but as to the Mode of its Introduction,
there is a Spread of impenetrable Darkness over the Face of that
great Deep; after the most critical Disquisitions about it, the Difficulty
remains unsolvable.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men of Letters may give their Conjectures, but it seems to be
one of those secret Things which belongs to him who is unsearchable,
and <i>whose ways are past finding out</i>; therefore we should rather
think, <i>how to get Sin out of the World, than how it came in at
first</i>: The one would only prove what our Understandings could
do, but the other would declare our Hearts, what they ought to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>What this Serpent was, that triumph’d in Paradise, has been
a Subject of long Debate, and the Learned are not yet agreed in
their Verdict about it. I shall first lay down their various Opinions,
and then give my own Conjectures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the <i>Jews</i>, some took it for a real, natural Serpent,
and did believe, it was endued with the Gift of Speaking; but because
it deceived the Woman, was condemn’d to lose its vocal

<p class='c013'>Others, who, not allowing the Privilege of Speech to a
Brute, have turn’d the <i>Mosaic History</i> of Paradise into an <i>Allegory</i>,
an Assemblage of Metaphors, or figurative Documents. Thus a
certain learned <i>Jew</i> says, the <i>Serpent</i>, that seduced the Woman,
<i>was Pleasure</i>; and forbidden Pleasure, when tasted, brought forth
Death<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c019'><sup>[337]</sup></a>.</p>

the Serpent is not only to go upon its Breast, but, <i>and thou shalt
go upon thy Belly</i>. <i>q. d.</i> “Since Pleasure was thy Desire, let the
Pleasure of the Earth enter into it. The <i>Belly</i>, says the <i>Allegorizer</i>,
is the Receptacle of most Pleasures of the Animal Kind.”
Creatures that go upon four Feet, or more, are deem’d impure;
and such is he, who is a Lover of terrene Pleasures; such a Person
may be said, always to go upon his Belly, because he studies
nothing more than its Gratification. Pleasure indeed, is attended
with a Train of Allurements and Charms. <i>Tarquin</i>’s violent Pursuit
of forbidden Pleasure, terminated, not only in the Ruin of
his House, but Extirpation of Monarchy: <i>Crœsus</i> King of <i>Lydia</i>
being conquer’d by <i>Cyrus</i> King of <i>Persia</i>, gave the Conqueror this
Advice, If you would have the <i>Lydians</i> be your obedient Slaves,
make them <i>Slaves to Pleasure</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor is <i>Philo</i> alone in making the Serpent a Symbol of Pleasure,
for <i>Maimonides</i> and others expound those historical Passages
in the same manner; asking, Why should that Serpent be call’d a
subtle Beast, if it were not in a figurative Sense? In favour of
this Exposition, he quotes several Passages out of the Prophets,
that are allow’d to be intirely allegorical<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c019'><sup>[338]</sup></a>; and then adds, that
in <i>Moses’s Journal of the Creation</i>, all things therein are not to be
understood literally<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c019'><sup>[339]</sup></a>. One of the most learned Fathers seems
inclined to this <i>Philonick Interpretation of Moses</i><a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c019'><sup>[340]</sup></a>. It is observable,
that in reality, ’twas not the <i>Pleasure of Eating</i> which
tempted the Woman, but an anxious <i>Desire of greater Wisdom</i>;
which shews a more refined Taste in <i>Eve</i>, and overthrows the
Hypothesis of <i>Philo</i> and <i>Clemens</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some Rabbinical Writers say, the Devil that deluded the Woman,
came mounted upon a Serpent, in Bulk equal to a Camel,
and known by the Name <i>Sammael</i>, an Evil Angel; called also by
them, the <i>Angel of the Dead</i>, Prince of the aerial Region, and
Chief of the Demons. Other Rabbies look upon him as the
Prince of Angels; and believe, he is to preside at the last Judgment;
for which Reason, they make him Offerings on the Day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of solemn Expiation, to appease his Indignation<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c019'><sup>[341]</sup></a>. ’Tis said,
this Serpent eat the forbidden Fruit and did not die for it; the
Woman inferred she might also eat, and not die.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Others there are, who will not allow the seducing Serpent
to be an <i>Animal</i>, but the <i>Devil</i> himself in that Shape, who therefore
in the sacred Writings is called the <i>great Dragon, old Serpent,
and Murderer from the Beginning</i>. And some are of Opinion,
he borrowed the Body of a real Serpent, which he made
use of, as a Vehicle, thro’ which he instilled Poison into the Woman’s
Mind: And if so, what occasion to say the Serpent was more
subtle than any Beast?——Since the grand Enemy in tempting
<i>Eve</i>, did not use the Craft of the Serpent, but his own Cunning,
in the Management of that cruel Stratagem.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who are not pleased with such Ratiocinations, satisfy
themselves with this, <i>viz.</i> That our first Parents, in whose Loins
we were, transgrest, and made a Forfeiture of Paradise for themselves
and Descendants; but the manner how they fell is not obvious,
nor to be accounted for, in a State of Imperfection.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it be ask’d, Why did not the divine Goodness put our first
Parents beyond a Capacity of sinning? ’tis answer’d,</p>

<p class='c013'>That <i>Mutability is essential to all Creatures</i>, as such, in all
their Kinds: In this mutable State our first Parents were created,
holy and happy: Life and Death were set before them; they had
freedom of Choice, a free-will to use the Powers of Nature as they
pleased; that is, they were made in a State of Liberty, with a
Power to determine for themselves, whether to abide or not in
that glorious Situation. So that if there be a Difficulty in accounting
for the Fall, there is as great a one in supposing a reasonable
moral Creature uncapable of Choice: for where there is no Choice,
there can be no Virtue; and where there is no Virtue, there can
be no Happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve were arm’d with a sufficient Power
to stand</i>, being created after the divine Image pure and upright,
without Error in their intellectual Powers; therefore if they mistook
the Object, or were imposed upon, ’twas not for want of
Light in the Mind, but want of Application of that Light, which
was in their power.... Which Light told them, the Tree of Life
planted in Paradise, was to perpetuate their Lives; and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Tree that had the Marks of Death upon it, would do them no
harm, but by doing their own Will, or the Will of any other in
opposition to his sovereign Will who had said, <i>Eat not</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were created pure, and capable of Perseverance; and
when they fell, God did not withdraw any Gift he had conferred
upon them: He did all that was necessary on his Part for their Preservation,
and they had remain’d safe, if their Liberty had but
conducted itself aright: Their Liberty was not tied to any particular
Object, as their other Faculties were, but respected every thing
that could be done, or left undone, and it might have imploy’d
them after another manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s said, <i>Out of the Ground made the Lord God to grow every
Tree that is pleasant to the Sight, and good for Food; and the Tree
of Knowledge of Good and Evil, of which thou shalt not eat</i>. Gen.
ii. 9, 17. Now, where lay the Difficulty of <i>not eating</i>, when
they were in no want of Food? And if in want, were not all
the Fruits of Paradise prepared for them? Why would none serve
but what was prohibited? And nothing prohibited but what was
deadly Poison, and what <i>Adam</i> knew to be so, by immediate
Revelation from Heaven.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus furnish’d with divine Armour, and all the agreeable Entertainments
of Life, ’tis most surprizing how they should indulge
an irregular Turn in the animal Passions, and give way to such
Inadvertency. One thing that might lead them to this Oversight,
probably was, that they knew of <i>no Enemy</i>, therefore dreaded <i>no
Danger</i>. But this Plea is of no force; for their Business was
strictly to regard the Voice of their Creator (who said, <i>Eat not</i>)
and not to give heed to any contrary Insinuations, tho’ proposed
by a known Friend, much less by a Stranger, one of another
Kingdom, and of another Species, without sufficient Attestation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here <i>Lucifer</i> play’d the Orator: He gave his Argument all
the Rhetorick it would bear, by removing their <i>fear of Death</i>,
and gratifying in them a certain Hope of <i>being Gods</i>. The Woman
had the Threatning of Death in her Thoughts, and therefore
durst not eat till she was made to believe, <i>she should not die</i>;
(by which it appears, she had dreadful Ideas of dying.) And
thus she was tempted to <i>Unbelief</i>. Then Satan proposes the glorious
Advantages of <i>Eating</i>, viz. <i>Ye shall be as Gods</i> ... be independent
Beings, not subject to the Controul of a superior Power;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and thus they were tempted to <i>Pride</i>. <i>Unbelief</i> and <i>Pride</i> were
the two fatal Rocks, on which their Innocence was wreck’d.
Thus our first Parents fell, not for want of <i>Light</i>, but for extinguishing
it; not for want of <i>Power</i>, but for not using it in the
Hour of Danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Enemy having made his Conquest, might probably continue
for some time in <i>Eden</i>, to assist the Woman in seducing her
Husband, and then confirm them in their Apostacy, directing
them, upon the Approach of an Enemy, to hide themselves among
the Trees of the Garden, where he left them; upon which
he return’d to his Kingdom in the Air, to publish his successful
Atchievements in Paradise, and was no more heard of, till he was
summon’d to the Bar.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Devil’s principal Residence is in the Air, where he keeps
his Court, from whence he sends out his Angels to secure and enlarge
his Conquests. Perhaps, he may think it not consistent
with the Dignity of so great a Prince to traverse the Earth in
Person, unless it be upon some extraordinary Occasions, as that
of tempting the first and second <i>Adam</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The next Thing that offers itself, is an Attempt to illustrate
the Case between the Woman and Serpent: It seems most apparent
to me, that under the Name of the Serpent, we are to understand
the Devil, who made use of a real Serpent in his Descent
upon Paradise, where he decoy’d the first Woman into the fatal
Snare.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Curse upon the Serpent, ’tis said, the <i>Seed of the Woman
should break the Serpent’s Head</i>; intimating, the Serpent having
its <i>Heart</i> under the <i>Throat</i>, and very near the <i>Head</i>, the readiest
way to kill it, is to squeeze the Head. Some of the Fathers
bring four Proofs of the Serpent’s Wisdom; trite and common.</p>

<p class='c013'>1. When ’tis old, it has the Secret of growing young again,
by stripping off its old Skin, which is succeeded by a new Coat;
but if it parts with its outward Garments, it retains its Poison.
Herein it is resembled by those, who leave the outward Acts of
Sin, but not their secret Regards for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The Serpent assaults a Man if he sees him naked, but flies
if it finds him cloathed. But there is a Fault in this Passage of
<i>Epiphanius</i>, who intends to say the contrary; for ’tis generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>affirm’d, that the Serpent is afraid of a naked Man, but attacks
him if he has Clothes on.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. When the Serpent is assaulted, its chief Care is to secure
its Head: ’Tis attested by many Writers, that to save the Head,
it will expose the whole Body to Danger<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c019'><sup>[342]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>4. When it goes to drink, it vomits up all its Poison, for
fear of poisoning itself. Some have defended this, but without
any Colour of Reason<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c019'><sup>[343]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>They relate other Instances of the Serpent’s Wisdom, as stopping
its Ears, that it may not hear the Voice of the Charmer or
Inchanter; of which the <i>Psalmist</i> takes notice. ’Tis said, it applies
one of its Ears hard to the Ground, and stops up the other
with the end of its Tail, <i>Psal.</i> lviii. 4. Others say, its Wisdom
consists in Acuteness of Sight; therefore among the <i>Greeks</i>, a Serpent’s
Eye was a proverbial Speech for one of a quick Understanding<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c019'><sup>[344]</sup></a>.
These are some of the common Reasons assigned for the
Wisdom of the Serpent.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>I Now proceed to an Illustration of the Debate between the
Woman and Serpent in Paradise, under three Heads.</p>
<p class='c033'>I. <i>WHY may not we suppose, that in the Infancy of Mankind
there was an open Intercourse between the angelick and human World,
and that Angels might appear to our first Parents in some visible
Form, as afterwards they did to the Patriarchs?</i> If this be not
granted, I would ask how a fallen Angel came to know there was
a Paradise, and a certain Tree whose Fruit was forbidden, and
where that Tree was situated in the Garden?</p>

<p class='c013'>When a certain Province of Angels rebelled, they were
doom’d to the wide Space contiguous to our Globe, and by their
daily Rovings from Place to Place, they might indeed discover
that little Spot of Earth, called <i>Paradise</i>; but how came they to
be acquainted with the Laws of that Country, and that there was
a forbidden Tree, and where it grew? How, I say, could they
know all this without Revelation, or previous Conversation with
the Inhabitants of the Place?</p>
<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>II. <i>IF there had been no former Acquaintance between Angels
and our first Parents, how came the Woman to converse so freely
with a Stranger she had never seen before, one of another Country,
and of a different Species?</i> ’Tis therefore probable, that when the
Devil addrest the Woman, and that in her own Language, he
might assume the Form of a good Angel, that Form in which
Angels had discoursed with our first Parents before the Fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>And perhaps when Angels, the Messengers of Heaven, conversed
with <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>, it might be in the Shape of flying
speaking Serpents. Without allowing this mutual Intercourse,
and former Familiarity, we can’t well suppose that our first Parents,
tho’ not furnish’d with so much Knowledge as is usually
ascribed to them, would be conquer’d by a <i>Demon</i> in the Shape
of a <i>Serpent</i>, which naturally is a Beast of the Field, and known
to be so by <i>Adam</i>, who, but a little before, had enrolled it among
his Subjects, and given it a significant Name.</p>

<p class='c013'>Can we imagine our first Parents so stupid, as to hold a Conversation
with a Beast, without Surprize, Jealousy, and Suspicion?
<i>Adam</i>, who knew the Properties of inferior Animals, (to whom
he had given proper Names a little before) could not but know,
that the <i>Serpent</i> was a <i>Beast</i>, and had no Organs fitted for the
Formation of articulate Sounds, much less a Power to fix proper
Ideas to them, and support an Argument by arguing the Case in a
rational manner. Could <i>Adam</i>, who was the Image of God upon
Earth, hear a Brute speak and dispute in the Language of Paradise,
without a Suspicion of Imposture or something ominous?</p>

<p class='c013'>During the Woman’s Parley with the Serpent, <i>Adam</i> is supposed
to be absent, perhaps thro’ Satan’s Management, and upon
her representing to him at their next meeting, the Conversation
she had with the Serpent, he must conclude that Serpent to be a
<i>grand Cheat</i>, or a <i>good Angel</i>, that spoke to his Wife: and that
he took it in the latter Sense, is plain from the Event; that is, his
taking the forbidden Fruit, and eating thereof upon the Serpent’s
Recommendation of it to his Wife, who found no ill Effect from
her Compliance. Now, the Tempter having assur’d the Woman
that her eating that Fruit would not bring Death, and <i>Adam</i> finding
it to be true in Fact, that is, that she did eat and live after it,
concluded he might eat with equal Safety.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Upon this Supposition, we may charitably infer, that since
our first Mother might converse with Angels in that serpentine,
or some other bright Form, she now converses with the Serpent
without Scruple or Dread of Imposture. And as she apprehended
the Serpent to be a good and kind Spirit, so <i>Adam</i> did, upon her
Representation of the Matter, and took the forbidden Fruit, and
eat it: And perhaps the Serpent was present, giving Attestation to
the Report made by the Woman to her Husband.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being granted, ’tis conceivable how the Woman might
freely converse with a Creature that assum’d an Image so glorious,
especially if we consider she was in her infantile State, and without
any experimental Knowledge, or any Apprehension of Danger,
from an Enemy, of which she had no Idea; being no Sinner,
she was without Fear.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Sentence past upon <i>Adam</i>, there is one Clause that seems
to corroborate this Hypothesis; for, upon the Expulsion of our
first Parents ... the Gates of <i>Eden</i> were guarded by a <i>Cherub</i> (to
prevent their re-entrance) which, by the <i>Jews</i>, was esteem’d a
<i>second Angel</i>, and may be aptly imagin’d to be a <i>Seraph</i>, or an
Angel in the Form of a flying Serpent, whose Body vibrated in
the Air, with a peculiar Resplendency, and may be fitly describ’d
by the Image of such a Sword. ’Tis said, <i>God drove out the Man,
and placed at the East-end of the Garden of Eden, Cherubims and a
flaming Sword, which turned every way, to keep the Way of the
Tree of Life</i>, Gen. iii. <i>ult.</i> God made Angels Guardians of Paradise,
and a sparkling Fire, like a flaming Sword; says the <i>Arabick</i>
Version.</p>

<p class='c013'>But why may not this Text bear an Interpretation pregnant
with good Tidings, as an Explication of the Promise made to the
Woman, that is, an Instruction to our first Parents how to worship
God after the Fall, namely by Sacrifice, which was to be offer’d
by them before the <i>Cherubims</i> (erected over the Gates of
Paradise) as Sacrifices afterwards were before the <i>Cherubims</i> in the
<i>Tabernacle</i> and <i>Temple</i>, or, as the <i>Hebrew</i>, before the <i>Faces of
Jehovah</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>flaming Sword and the Cherubims</i>, might be Emblems or
Figures of some things to be observed in the Form of Worship design’d
for that new Dispensation. The <i>fiery Sword</i> being a killing
Weapon, might represent irritated Justice; and <i>Cherubims</i> being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the Inhabitation of the Deity in the Tabernacle and Temple,
might be an Emblem of Mercy, to which the Sacrifices were offer’d:
and may not Cherubims be so construed here? <i>N. B.</i> May
we not date the first Institution of Sacrifice here, which soon appear’d
in the History of <i>Cain</i> and <i>Abel</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'>God might address our first Parents after this manner; View
these wonderful Sights over the Gate, behold in them the Scheme
of Salvation! The Text thus interpreted, gives the Tempter a
fresh Mortification, to see his bloody Design defeated, and our
first Parents restored to Favour at the Gate of <i>Eden</i>, in which he
had triumph’d over them; and that which encreased his Vexation
was, to see this done by <i>Christ</i>, the promised Seed, one of the human
Race.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Tabernacle and Temple there were no Representations
of God, but only emblematical Figures erected over the Mercy-Seat,
called the Cherubims; in, or between them, the <i>Deity</i> is
said <i>to dwell</i>; and the Law obliged the <i>Jews</i> to bring the Blood
of the Sacrifice <i>before the Face of God</i> in the Cherubims, that is,
within the Vail, on the Day of Expiation: and here God might
direct our first Parents to bring their Sacrifices to him, who was
in a special manner present in the Cherubims over the Gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>But supposing <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> had, after their Expulsion, enter’d
Paradise; I don’t see what valuable End it would have answered,
for the special Promises made to the first Inhabitants of
Paradise were now null and void. All the Blessings peculiar to
that glorious Situation, were irrecoverably lost. It was not in the
power of that once sacred Seat to reinstate them in their pristine
Happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Obj.</i> Could not the Tree of Life restore their forfeited Comforts?
I presume not; because the Tree of Life, in the Design
of it, was to perpetuate the happy Life of innocent Man, and not
to restore the Life and Comforts of Criminals under a Sentence
of Death; a Sentence irrepealable, which even the Death of our
Blessed Redeemer does not exempt us from.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the whole, I can scarcely think that these strange and
awful Sights or Figures, over the East Gate of <i>Eden</i>, were only
to frighten our first Parents, whose distressed State stood in need
of Divine Supports. To be cast out of Paradise was a Mortification
that needed not a super-added Terror; therefore to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>those Figures Spectacles of Horror, seems not so well suited to
Persons under Circumstances so inexpressibly dolorous, tho’ restored
to Favour; but might rather be design’d to conduct them
to God by <i>Christ</i>, the <i>Tree of Life</i>.</p>
<p class='c033'>III. <i>IT’s very probable a Conversation had past between the Woman
and Serpent before the Narrative publish’d by Moses.</i> She
might upon the first Approach of the Serpent ask, How a Beast
acquired the Gift of Speaking, which is the Prerogative of Rationals?
The Serpent might answer, That it was by Eating the
Fruit of that Tree. <i>Eve</i> might urge, That God had forbid her
to eat that Fruit upon pain of Death. The Serpent might make
this Return, <i>viz.</i> What you say is true; ’tis allow’d to be the
Law under the first Form of Government, but I am now come
from the supreme Court, to give you Assurance of God’s kind
Intentions to advance you to a higher and more noble Station:
The Prohibition of this Fruit was only a probationary Restraint,
and temporary.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the End of the first Institution being answered, ’tis the
Will of our Great Sovereign to take off those Restraints, and
make you a free People. Upon the Formation of your Being,
he brighten’d your Mind with Rays of great Wisdom; but now
the happy Moment is come, in which he purposes to inspire you
with higher Degrees of Wisdom.... By eating this Fruit, your
intellectual Powers will be infinitely enlarged; for, <i>ye shall be as
Gods</i>, and then all the Endowments and Accomplishments of Nature
will arrive at their full Perfection, which as yet are only in
their Embryo. This being only a Supposition, I dismiss it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpent having ascrib’d its Reason, and Speech to the
eating of that Fruit, the Woman might infer, If this Fruit did
turn a Serpent into a rational Creature, why may it not transform
a rational Creature into a God, and a <i>Woman</i> into a <i>Goddess</i>?
The Serpent had no occasion to say more; fir’d with the Prospect
of such Preferment, she <i>took the Fruit and did eat</i>. Gen. iii. 6.
<i>And when the Woman saw that the Tree was good for Food, pleasant
to the Eye, and a Tree to be desired to make one wise, she did eat.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>N. B.</i> How divine and delightful a Thing is Knowledge, of
which Innocency itself is ambitious! <i>Eve</i> thirsted after the highest
Degrees of Knowledge, and made no doubt of obtaining it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the Serpent’s Instructions; not knowing of any Impostor, she believed
what the Tempter said. Satan, by the Serpent, as a Bait
proposed Improvement in Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the first Woman, Head of the human Race, fell a Sacrifice
to her own Ambition, fell a Virgin, and in her Infant-State.
<i>Icarus</i>, by flying too near the Sun, his waxen Wings
melted, and he fell into the Sea, and was drowned. Justly was
he punish’d, for not observing his Father’s Will. May I add, in
favour of our Mother, that the Law forbidding that Fruit, was
not immediately publish’d to <i>Eve</i>, but receiv’d at second-hand
from <i>Adam</i>; and that it can’t be well supposed, that she knew
the various Capacities and Qualities of Brutes, as her Husband
did.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, why does <i>Moses</i> introduce a Serpent speaking, when
naturally it was a speechless Creature?</p>

<p class='c013'>In answer to this, may we not observe, that the Almighty,
who has no <i>material Tongue</i>, yet is often introduced, speaking
with <i>human Voice</i> in the Scripture. The <i>Egyptians</i> made the <i>Crocodile</i>
a Symbol of the Deity, giving this as a Reason why they
worshipped God symbolically in that Creature, because it resembled
God, in that it was the only Animal without a Tongue;
for the Divine λογος stands in no need of Speech; he governs human
Affairs without Words, and without Noise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, this Dialogue with the Serpent, a known Beast, is
very agreeable to a Custom among the Oriental Writers, who enchase
their Histories with Ornaments taken from familiar Discourses
between Beasts; by which they convey moral Instructions
to their Readers: Thus, on a Subject of Craft, they made the
Fox to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what View did the Devil tempt our first Parents to
sin? I answer, ’twas out of despite to God; <i>i. e.</i> with a design
to rob the Creator of the Glory he proposed to himself from the
Erection of this new World: He could not attack the Almighty
on his Throne, therefore he strikes at the Footstool. Since he
could not reach the Person of the Almighty, he wreaks his Malice
upon his <i>Image</i>, Man; Man, whose Happiness, and that of
his Descendants, he envy’d; and whom, in particular he hated,
as his intended Successors to the vacant Seats in the blissful Regions
above.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>In his Plot against <i>Adam</i>, the Deceiver was deceived; for he
made no doubt but the Sentence of Death would be immediately
executed upon <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>, and upon the Extinction of the
human Species, God would lose all his Honour upon Earth. Why
did not he appear to our first Parents in a human Form? probably
because he might apprehend, that there was no other Man
or Woman, but themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having considered <i>Adam</i> in his probationary Capacity, I
shall in the next place observe these three Things, by way of
Illustration.</p>
<p class='c045'>I. <i>It was most congruous that Man’s first State should be a State of
Trial.</i> II. <i>That his Trial should be by the Laws of his Creator.</i>
III. <i>That those Laws should be inforced by a proper Sanction.</i></p>
<p class='c033'>I. <i>IT was congruous and fit, our first Parents should begin their
Life in a way of Trial, as they were moral Agents</i>: In which Situation
I apprehend all the Angels to be at first, to see how they
would behave towards the Great Author of their Being and Blessedness,
before they were establish’d. No Creature, as such, is
capable of Immutability, any more than of Omnipotence. To
be naturally, and necessarily immutable, is the sole Prerogative of
the Almighty: The perpetual Duration of created Beings, is not
from their Nature, but from the Divine Will.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our first Parents were under a strong Guard, and not to be
disarm’d without their own Consent; tho’ the Devil, as he was a
Spirit, excelled in Power, yet he could not by Force subdue the
weaker Vessel, therefore conducted the bloody Design by Stratagems.
When the Woman was sollicited by the Tempter, one
strong <i>Negative</i> would have put him to <i>flight</i>. A resolute Denial,
without any other Means, would have made her victorious, tho’
assaulted by all the Legions of Hell; therefore, no room to complain
of Deficiency in Divine Goodness.</p>

<p class='c013'>’Tis beyond all doubt, that the Revelation given to <i>Adam</i> (as
that to Christian Churches in After-ages) made it a fundamental
part of his Duty, not to attend to any Insinuations contrary to
those delivered to him by his Creator, tho’ recommended even by
an Angel from Heaven: Temptations to forbidden Fruit, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>pleasant, should not be parley’d with, but peremptorily rejected.</p>
<p class='c033'>II. <i>IT was equally proper, that a Creature should be govern’d
by the Laws of his Creator</i>; as it implies a Contradiction for a
Creature to be independent, which it must suppose itself to be,
when govern’d by its own Laws. The Will of the Creator was
surely the fittest, for the Obedience of Creatures; one part of
which was, that they must not have an Indulgence of all the
Trees in <i>Eden</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It follows hence, that <i>Self-denial was a Duty in Paradise</i>.
<i>Adam</i> was not an absolute Sovereign to do what he pleased, but
what his Almighty Creator and Patron prescribed; tho’ endowed
with Reason, yet was he to govern himself by the Will of another,
that is, of him who was the Donor. His Reason was a
bright, but borrowed Light, borrowed from the uncreated Sun,
therefore ought to move by its Direction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus we see that Restraints on the human Nature, were necessary
even in Man’s Paradisaical State: To deny Self, was one
of the Precepts of Religion in the Garden of Innocence; nor is
this strange, if we consider, that for any rational Creature to live
according to his own Will, is to make a <i>God</i> of his <i>Will</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why did God forbid the Fruit of one Tree? This might be
to signify <i>Adam</i>’s Dependance upon his Maker, and that he had
no Claim to any thing without his Leave: The sovereign Lord of
the Creation made over to <i>Adam</i> large Dominions, and the Mannour
of Paradise for the Seat of his Empire, reserving nothing to
himself but a small Rent of Acknowledgment, which was only
the Fruit of one Tree. The Exemption of this Tree from human
Use, notify’d Man’s Subjection, and God’s supreme Dominion.
By this Reservation he tried their Obedience, whether
they would be content with all the Earth, and Appurtenances
thereunto belonging, one Tree only excepted. <i>N. B.</i> This forbidden
Tree might have something of a natural Tendency to corrupt
the animal Juices, and introduce Diseases and Death into the human
Nature. If the Tree of Life could immortalize our Existence
in Happiness, is it not equally rational to suppose the Tree of
Knowledge ... would destroy it?</p>
<p class='c033'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>III. <i>THE Laws of Paradise were inforced by a very awful
Sanction</i>, viz. <i>Life and Death</i>: The one expressing something
most terrible, the other implying somewhat vastly delightful.
Threatnings were necessary Cautions in Paradise: How surprizing
this! The first day of Man’s Life, Man was put in mind of
Death, of which the Tree of Life was a Memento. If you eat
the Fruit of it, you forfeit your Life, <i>die you must</i> without Remedy.
This Menace of Death, in the Design of it, was to guard
against Sin, as that which only could be the Cause of Death.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>IN the day thou eatest thereof</i>, dying thou shalt die; or, die
the Death. Behold here! as in a Cloud, the first Alarm of Mortality,
the first Institution of Funerals, and the melancholy Office
of Grave-diggers. Bells from the Pinnacle of the Temple, proclaim
it aloud to Man, <i>Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt
return</i>. In this paradisaical Scheme of Government, we find
Death to be a near Neighbour to Life: Both the Trees grew near
to one another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some have made this <i>Tree of Life</i> a Representation of <i>Christ</i>,
and if so, here, as in a Glass, darkly Man saw his Saviour before
he stood in need of him: The Tree of Life planted in the midst
of Paradise, was to preserve <i>Adam</i>’s Life, and without doubt had
done so, if he had not rebelled. According to a Learned <i>Jew</i>,
the Tree of Life represents Piety; and that of Knowledge, Prudence<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c019'><sup>[345]</sup></a>.
Some of his Countrymen tell us ridiculous Stories about
the Tree of Life, <i>viz.</i> That it was of prodigious Size, and all
the Water of the Earth gush’d out at its Foot, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>It is from the History of Paradise that pagan Poets took their
<i>Nectar</i> and <i>Ambrosia</i>, which were said to be the Meat and Drink
of the Gods; upon which some put this Construction, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Nectar</i> signifies <i>young</i>; <i>Ambrosia</i>, <i>Immortality</i>; intimating, that
in a State of Innocency, the Vigor of Youth would have been
immortal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Heathen were not without some Idea of the Mosaic
Creation, and Fall of Man, and of a Woman that brought Sorrow
into the World; envying, that a Fire, which is the Light
of Knowledge, was hid from them ... and also of Old-Age,
brought in by the Counsel of a Serpent.——</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Paradise, in <i>Plato</i>’s <i>Symposium</i>, is <i>Jupiter</i>’s <i>Garden</i>, and
also is the Pattern of <i>Alcinous</i>’s <i>Orchards</i>, and the <i>Hesperides</i>:
The Golden-Apples kept by a <i>Dragon</i>, were the forbidden Fruit
in Paradise: The Fable of <i>Hercules</i>’s killing the Serpent of the
<i>Hesperides</i>, is borrowed from the Seed of the Woman, breaking
the Serpent’s Head.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is <i>Ovid</i>’s <i>In nova fert animus</i>? but an imperfect
Transcript of <i>Moses</i>’s Journal of the Creation, <i>&amp;c.</i> ’Tis said by
<i>Moses</i>, <i>The Spirit of God moved on the Face of the Waters</i>; hence
<i>Thales</i>, makes Water to be the first Principle of all natural Bodies:
His Reasons are deliver’d by <i>Plutarch</i>. <i>Homer</i> says, All things
are made of the Ocean. The <i>Chaos</i>, whereof all things were

and the Causes that brought it upon the World.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is the <i>Bacchus</i> of the Heathen, but the <i>Noah</i> of <i>Moses</i>?
formerly called <i>Boachus</i>, for <i>Noachus</i>, as might easily be,
mistaking the <i>Hebrew</i> Letters B and N, which are not very much
unlike. By <i>Janus</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Noah</i> is meant; and some take
<i>Jupiter</i> to be <i>Japhet</i>, for tho’ <i>Jovis</i>, and the other oblique Cases
are derived from <i>Jehovah</i>, yet <i>Jupiter</i> is another. The Fable
of Heaven being stormed by the <i>Giants</i>, arose from what the
Builders of the <i>Tower of Babel</i> said, <i>viz.</i> <i>Let us build a City and
a Tower, whose Top may reach unto Heaven</i>.... But no Man
imitates the Scriptures more than <i>Homer</i>, who was an inquisitive
Traveller into all Countries. But to proceed to the Pagan Account
of Paradise, and the Fall of Man:</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain Author relates a Discourse between <i>Midas</i>
the <i>Phrygian</i>, and <i>Silenus</i> who was the Son of a <i>Nymph</i>, inferior
by Nature to the Gods, superior to Men and Death, thus:</p>

<p class='c013'><i>SILENUS</i> told <i>Midas</i>, that <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Africa</i> were
Islands, surrounded by Water: that there was but one Continent
only, which was beyond this World, in which, among other
Rarities, were two great <i>Rivers</i>, whose Banks were cover’d with
<i>Trees</i>, one of them was called the <i>River of Pleasure</i>, and the
other the <i>River of Grief</i>....</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>He who eat the Fruit of the Trees along the River of Pleasure,
was eased from all his former Desires, and in a short time
became younger, and lived over again his former Years, cast off
Old-Age, and became first a Young Man, then a Child, and
lastly an Infant, and so died.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, he who eat the Fruit from the Trees by
the River of Grief, spent all his Days in Tears and Troubles, and
after many Years of Vexation, dies.</p>

<p class='c013'>How romantick soever this Relation may be, it seems to allude
to the <i>Trees</i> and <i>Rivers</i> of Paradise, and to give some Hints
about the Introduction of Death.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Indians</i> account for the Fall of Man after this manner:—<i>Brama</i>,
one of their subaltern Deities, form’d Man out of
the Slime of the Earth that was then just created, and placed
him in a certain Situation, which they call <i>Chorcham</i>, which was
a Garden of Delights, abounding with all manner of pleasant
Fruit, in which was a certain Tree, whose Fruit would confer
Immortality upon any Persons that were allow’d to eat it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Gods</i>, say the <i>Indians</i>, tried all sorts of Means to obtain
the Privilege of this Immortality; and after great Difficulties, did
at last succeed according to their Wish, and found out the Way
to the Tree of Life, which was in the <i>Chorcham</i>, and by feeding
on its Fruit for some time, they commenced immortal.</p>

<p class='c013'>A famous Serpent called <i>Cheieu</i>, (probably Guardian of
that Tree) perceiving the Secret was discover’d by the Gods of
the second Rank, was so enraged, that it scatter’d a Flood of
Poison over the Plain. All the Earth felt the fatal Effects, and
no Man escaped the Infection: But the God <i>Chiven</i>, took pity
on the human Nature, appear’d in the Shape of Man, and swallow’d
all the mortal Poison, wherewith the malicious Serpent
had infected the Universe.... This Fable, as ridiculous as it is,
must have some regard to the terrestrial Paradise, and can have no
other Original but the Doctrine of <i>Moses</i><a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c019'><sup>[347]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor were the more western Pagans more happy in their Conjectures
about the first Entrance of moral Evil. <i>Prometheus</i>,
say they, having form’d Men out of the Earth and Water, animated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>them with Fire, which he stole from Heaven. <i>Jupiter</i>,
the Chief of the Pagan Gods, enraged at this, commands <i>Vulcan</i>
to make a Woman out of Clay, upon whom all the Gods,

of their Perfections. <i>Venus</i> gave her Beauty; <i>Pallas</i>, Wisdom;

was too cautious to receive it; upon which she was to present it to
his Brother <i>Epimetheus</i>, (supposed by some to be her Husband)
which he had no sooner open’d, but immediately there flew out
<i>all kinds of Evil</i>, that soon scatter’d themselves over all the Earth;
and at the bottom of the Box, nothing was left but poor <i>Hope</i>.</p>

<p class='c031'>The <i>Mahometan Account of Man’s Fall</i>, is equally absurd, as
appears from <i>Mahomet Rabadan, &amp;c.</i> thus:—God made the Creation
... the earthly Mass became an animate Body ... and was called
<i>Adam</i>; God placed him in heavenly Paradise, and lest he should
believe that he had no Superior, God gave him only one Command,
the Observation of which was very easy. He forbid him, upon
pain of Death, to eat of the Fruit of a certain Tree. <i>Adam</i> wanted
a Mate; therefore God made him fall into a profound Sleep, and
took out of his left Side a Rib, of which he formed a very beautiful
Woman, whom he called <i>Eve</i>, ... and order’d <i>Gabriel</i> to go
into Paradise, and to celebrate the Wedding of <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>,
being attended with a great many other Angels.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>LUCIFER</i> envying the Happiness of Man, used his utmost
Endeavours to deprive him of it. Going one day by the
door of Paradise, he said to the Angel who kept it, <i>Give me leave
to go in, for I have a Matter of Moment to impart to the Servants
of thy Lord</i>. The Angel having denied his Request, he desired
him to call the Serpent, who was then a very fine Creature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The Serpent came, and <i>Lucifer</i> earnestly desired Leave to get into
his Body; the Serpent did so, and placed <i>Lucifer</i> in the Roof of
its Mouth, and carried him into Paradise. When he came near
the Forbidden Tree, it endeavoured in vain to make <i>Lucifer</i>
come out. <i>Lucifer</i> stuck fast, and forced the Serpent to get upon
that Tree, under which <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> used to sit down. <i>Eve</i>
was then alone, near the Tree: She saw the Serpent, who spoke
to the Woman in these Words, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Charming Creature, if you would taste this Fruit, you
would be <i>like God himself</i> in Wisdom and Knowledge: All the
Secrets and all the Mysteries you are now ignorant of, will be
manifested to you. <i>Adam</i> came during the Discourse, and having
told him what the Serpent had said, proposed to him to eat of the
forbidden Fruit, which after a Short Pause he comply’d with.
The Tree was a large Vine; <i>Eve</i> took twelve Grains of a Bunch
of Grapes, gave eight to her Husband, and kept four to herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that very moment, <i>Adam heard a very terrible Voice, Wo
to thee! hast thou so soon forgot the only Commandment thou hadst
promised to observe? how comes it that thou hast (by thy Greediness)
polluted the Purity of my Habitation?</i> <i>Adam</i> being confounded,
excused himself by laying the Fault upon <i>Eve</i>, who endeavour’d
to justify herself by accusing the Serpent. Upon which God
ordered the Angels immediately to drive <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> from
Paradise, to Strip them of their Clothes, and take away the
Crowns they had on their Heads<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c019'><sup>[349]</sup></a>.——But it is high time to

<p class='c013'>Satan, who imploy’d the Serpent in his Service, is supposed
to be punish’d here under the Figure of a Serpent: But why in
the Presence of our first Parents? Perhaps for such Reasons as
these, <i>viz.</i> 1. To reproach their Inadvertency for suffering themselves
to be imposed upon by a lying Spirit, who, if but resisted
by a meer Negation, would have fled. 2. To let them see that
no Creature, tho’ never so great, can rebel with Impunity; from
whence they might conclude, what to expect from new Provocations.
3. They had no other way to see a Spirit punish’d, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>under some visible Form. It could not but give them some secret
Satisfaction to see their cruel Enemy tremble at the Bar.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is observable here, that the <i>Promise of the Messiah</i> was made
to <i>Adam</i>, before the Almighty past upon him the Sentence of

before the Death of <i>Adam</i> was <i>pronounced</i>. The Death of
<i>Christ</i>, the <i>Innocent</i>; before the Death of <i>Adam</i>, the <i>Criminal</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last Remark I shall make here is, that the Earth, tho’
cursed for Man’s Sin, still puts on the Face of a Paradise, abounding
with an innumerable Variety of good Things; yea, and those
so delicious and pleasant to Mankind, that many wish to live in
it for ever. Thus they confine their Hopes and Fears to the present
State, and are so far from believing a Life to come, that
they can hardly persuade themselves to believe, that they shall
leave this present Life.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the Bounties of Providence gives us no room to murmur
at our present Province or Portion, so on the other hand, the
Toils and Troubles of this State should cause us to aspire after
the heavenly Paradise, where no Curse ever found Access, where
none of the Thorns of Affliction, or the Briers of Sorrow grow.</p>

Discontent and Murmuring, were the dominant Passions in the

No wonder that Rage and Faction haunt the Dwellings of good

<p class='c013'>A Magnificent Table was Spread for them in the Wilderness,
their daily Entertainments were miraculous; they were fed
by <i>Manna</i>, a delicious Food distilled from Heaven, admirably
suited to every one’s Palate. <i>He commanded the Clouds from above,

<p class='c013'>They were also furnish’d with <i>miraculous Drink</i>, i. e. <i>Water
out of a Rock</i>; Water that swell’d into a River, and follow’d ’em
in all their Motions, till they arrived in the Land <i>flowing with
Milk and Honey</i>; Terms, that include a Scene of Plenty and
Pleasantness.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all their Traverses through the Wilderness, they were always
under the Guidance and Protection of the <i>Shekina</i>; by
which Word the <i>Jews</i> understood the <i>Presence of the Holy Spirit</i>;
of <i>Christ</i>, say the Christians. The <i>Shekina</i> was the most sensible
Mark of the Presence of God among them, which rested over
the Propitiatory, or the golden Cherubims, which adher’d to the
Propitiatory or Covering of the Ark; there the <i>Shekina</i> abode in
the Shape of a Cloud. The <i>Rabbins</i> tell us, that it first resided
in the Tabernacle, and descended into it in the Figure of a Cloud,
on the Day of Consecration. It past from thence into the
Sanctuary of <i>Solomon’s Temple</i>, on the Day of its Dedication by
that Prince<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c019'><sup>[352]</sup></a>; where it continued to the Destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>

was a Crime of a high and heinous Nature, no less than
impeaching infinite Wisdom, and taxing it with erroneous Conduct:
If Difficulties occurred in the way, their Duty was <i>Resignation</i>,

<p class='c013'>Perhaps it might be to put them in remembrance of the
first Sin, that was introduced into Paradise by the old Serpent:
This kind of Punishment could not but bring to their Mind that
gloomy Moment in which the human Nature was morally and
mortally wounded by that evil Spirit, in the Form of a Serpent.
This being allow’d, we may infer, that Man’s Memory stands in
need of a Remembrancer, even of Paradise lost. And oh! who
can think of that inexpressible Loss, without dropping a silent
and solemn Tear?</p>

<p class='c013'>Some Learned <i>Jews</i> themselves, speaking upon this Subject,
say, the Reason why they were chastised by Serpents, was <i>because
they had done the Actions of the old Serpent, in using an ill Tongue
against God, against</i> Moses, <i>and Manna, the Bread of Heaven</i>.</p>

    <div class='c026'><i>WHY called Fiery Serpents?</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A natural and a moral Reason may be assigned for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>1. The sacred Volume seems to account for the <i>natural Reason</i>,
when it says, <i>God sent fiery Serpents</i>. The <i>Hebrew</i> word is
<i>Seraphim</i>, that is <i>Burners</i>, because they appeared in the form of
a <i>Flame</i>. The LXX calls them <i>Serpents of Death</i><a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c019'><sup>[353]</sup></a>, because
their <i>Wounds</i> proved <i>mortal</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>As soon as the People were wounded, their Blood was inflamed,
and according to some <i>Jewish</i> Authors, they were <i>scorch’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>with insatiable Thirst</i>. Of the <i>Hebrew</i> word <i>Saraph</i>, the
<i>Greeks</i>, by changing the Position and Order of Letters, have borrowed
the Name <i>Prester</i>, which is a kind of fiery venemous Serpent,
called also <i>Dipsas</i> and <i>Causon</i>, whose Wound is accompanied
with a most vehement Heat and Thirst, and generally incurable,
as some have formerly said. They may be properly called
<i>Fiery</i>, as their Colour was glowing, a proper Representative of
Fire. In the <i>West-Indies</i> are <i>Adders, red as Blood</i>, about seven
or eight Foot long, and appear by Night as a <i>burning Coal</i><a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c019'><sup>[354]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>2. They might be called <i>Fiery</i> also, from a <i>moral Consideration</i>;
for, that raging Heat in the Body might represent the outragious
Disorders of the Mind, flowing from conscious Guilt,
neither of which were the Attendants of an original State. Hence,
perhaps, it is that Satan’s <i>Temptations</i> are styled <i>fiery Darts</i>, because
when complied with, they kindle a Fire in the Conscience,
a Prognostick, and Taste of the Unquenchable<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c019'><sup>[355]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>And indeed, what are all uneasy Sensations, but the Venom
of the old Serpent? thence, that long Train of Complaints and
Groans. <i>Remember from whence thou art fallen</i>, is the Language
of every Calamity, but no calamitous Impression so terrible, as
that which alarms the Mind about the awful Futurity. Of Sin
it is said, that at last, <i>it will bite like a Serpent, and sting like an
Adder</i><a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c019'><sup>[356]</sup></a>.</p>

What made him run with wild Confusion among the Trees to

the Garden of God; whence then this sudden and mighty Panick?
What produced this great and astonishing Change in one
who had a friendly Intercourse with God a little before? Oh!
’twas Guilt, Guilt, Guilt. A Consciousness of his iniquitous
Compliance with the Serpent. What were those anxious disquieting
Thoughts that kindled the Fire in his Breast, but the venemous,
fiery Darts of Satan?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>JUDAS</i> is another Example; a Person highly honour’d by
Christ, who made him his Ambassador Extraordinary to the
House of <i>Israel</i>, and Treasurer of his House and Privy Counsellor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>on a sudden falls into Extremity of Anguish; and why? Guilt,
Guilt ... struck with Horror of Mind for the Effusion of innocent
Blood; was arraign’d, and sentenced by his own Conscience,
and became his own Executioner: His Guilt was the Wound
that bled within, and what Words can describe the Agony that
made that wretched Man throw himself into Hell for Ease.</p>

<p class='c013'>This gloomy Occurrence fell out in the last Year of their
Pilgrimage. The Wilderness thro’ which they had travelled
abounded with these venemous Creatures, but were under the
Restraint of a kind Providence, and not suffer’d to distress the
Camp of <i>Israel</i> till now. <i>Deut.</i> viii. 15. <i>Who led thee through the

<p class='c013'>Just as they were congratulating one another upon the glorious

their Camp, and made a terrible Slaughter among them.

<hr class='c030' />
<h3 class='c001'>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class='c031'>Among Serpents, we find some that are furnished with
Wings. <i>Herodotus</i> who saw those Serpents, says they had great
Resemblance to those which the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i> call’d <i>Hydræ</i>;
their Wings are not compos’d of Feathers like the Wings of Birds,
but rather like to those of <i>Batts</i>; they love sweet smells, and
frequent such Trees as bear Spices. These were the fiery Serpents
that made so great a Destruction in the Camp of <i>Israel</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In their Extremity, the People addrest their Mediator, Prophet,
and General, <i>Moses</i>, saying, <i>O pray to the Lord that he
take away the Serpents from us!</i> The meek Prophet did so; the
mediatorial Voice reach’d Heaven, and mov’d the Almighty who
directs <i>Moses</i> to make a Serpent of Brass, (which was a Figure of
the Serpents that plagued the People) and fix it upon the Top of
a Pole, conspicuous to all the Assembly, promising that all those
who were bit by Serpents, and should look upon this brazen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Image, should be presently healed. Astonishing Clemency! The
Event was answerable to this Promise.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Method of Cure was new and strange; but he who at
first called the World out of nothing, can with equal Facility
command Health out of a Piece of Brass. Another Observable
here, is that when the Almighty refused to hear the Cries of the
Wounded in their Distress, he readily hearkened to <i>Moses</i>’s Intercession
in their favour. Thus God accepted the Prayers of
<i>Job</i> for his three Friends, when he would not regard the Supplications
they put up for themselves. <i>Job</i> lxii. 7, 8.</p>
<hr class='c030' />
<h3 class='c001'>SECTION II.</h3>
<p class='c031'>The brazen Serpent was a Figure of the flying Serpent, <i>Saraph</i>,
which <i>Moses</i> fixed upon an erected Pole: That there were such, is
most evident. <i>Herodotus</i> who had seen of those Serpents, says
they very much resembled those which the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i>
called <i>Hydræ</i>: He went on purpose to the City of <i>Brutus</i> to see
those flying Animals, that had been devour’d by the <i>Ibidian</i>
Birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Asiatic-Georgia</i>, between the <i>Caspian</i> and <i>Euxine</i> Sea, are
found winged Dragons, with anserine Feet and venemous Claws;
and some of them are fortified with more terrible Pedestals than
others: their Wings are generally composed of strong nervous
Membranes, which when they walk, are scarcely visible, because
of their close Adherence to their lateral Parts<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c019'><sup>[358]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>Atlantic</i> Caves, and Mountains of <i>Africa</i>, is an infinite
Number of these winged Dragons, whose Poison is so strong,
that the Flesh of such as are wounded by them, immediately
grows soft, languid, and incurable<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c019'><sup>[359]</sup></a>. We read of flying Serpents

</div>

<p class='c013'>These also have been seen in <i>Florida</i> in <i>America</i>, where their
Wings are more flaccid, and so weak, that they cannot soar on
high. <i>Scaliger</i> describes a certain flying Serpent that was four
Foot long, and as thick as a Man’s Arm, whose Wings were cartilaginous,
or gristly, <i>ibid.</i> History accounts for one of these flying
Dragons that was killed in old <i>Aquitania</i> in <i>France</i>, a Present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of which was made to King <i>Francis</i>, as a great Rarity of
the Kind.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>JEROM CARDAN</i> informs us of some winged Dragons
he had seen at <i>Paris</i>, so nicely preserved, that they very much
resembled the Living; they were described with two Feet, weak
Wings, a serpentine Head, and of the Bigness of a Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why was the Deliverance of <i>Israel</i> by a Machine made in
the Form of a <i>Serpent</i>? Perhaps, these serpentine Strokes might
be intended as Emblems, or Memento’s of the fatal Wound in
Paradise, where Man’s Nature was first poisoned by the Devil,
who made use of a real Serpent to seduce our first Parents.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is moral Evil but the Venom of the old Serpent? A
Venom as pleasant to the Taste, as the forbidden Fruit to the
Eye, but the End is Bitterness. And what are Incentives to Sin,
but delusive Insinuations of the subtle Serpent? And what is Enjoyment,
but a pleasing Illusion, which is no sooner grasp’d, but
glides away as a Shadow, leaving behind it a wounded Conscience,
direful Apprehensions and Prospects.</p>

<p class='c013'>And what are all sensual Entertainments but so many hot
Gleams that portend the Approach of warring Winds and Storms?
The Powers of Darkness that excel in Science, know how to
regale the human Mind with pleasant Scenes, and how to divert
the Senses with delightful Charms; Charms that have no Existence
but in a deluded Imagination.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Cure by a brazen Serpent, might also be to shew, that
the Almighty in relieving distressed Supplicants, is not tied to any
particular Medium. When the <i>Israelites</i> were poison’d by real
Serpents, he heals them by the Image of a Serpent. When he
would destroy <i>Goliath</i> the Tyrant, he does it by a Sling in the
Hands of <i>David</i> a Youth, a very unlikely Person to encounter a
Champion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus God by the Figure of a Serpent mortifies the Pride
of <i>Lucifer</i>, the old Serpent, by which he acquir’d greater Honour,
than if he had sacrificed to the Fire all the Serpents in the
Wilderness.</p>

<p class='c013'>This may further intimate, that Providence may employ the
same Kind of Instruments, either for the Display of Mercy or
Justice upon Mankind. He who heals and wounds by the Mediation
of Serpents, can turn Blessings into a Curse, or enable us
to extract Sweetness out of the bitter Cup.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>This artificial Serpent might (as some have thought) prefigure
the <i>Messiah</i>, the Healer of spiritual Maladies. Many take
it for a Representation of his Passion and Crucifixion: The Analogy
may be thus illustrated, <i>viz.</i> The Cures wrought by the
Serpent and the Saviour, deriv’d their Efficacy from Divine Appointment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the <i>brazen</i> Serpent had been the mere Contrivance of
<i>Moses</i>, it would not have answer’d the Intention: so all human
Institutions adopted into Divine Worship will be as little available
to true Happiness, (<i>Who has required this at your Hand?</i>) of
that Sovereign, who accepts no Worship but what has the Sanction
of his Wisdom and Will.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both Cures were performed by the most unlikely Means.
The Serpent that healed their Wounds, was made of Brass; a
Prescription in which there was no Probability of producing that
happy Effect: And where was the promising Aspect arising from
the Manner of our Saviour’s Appearance on Earth? What great
Things could be expected from a Root of a dry Ground? How
improbable was it that a Person so mean in external Form should
overthrow the Kingdom of Darkness, a Kingdom that had been
strengthening its Barriers for about four thousand Years? Who
could think that he had such powerful Interest in Heaven, who
was of no Reputation on the Earth?</p>

<p class='c013'>Behold here a Scene of Paradoxes! Patients recovered by
the Death of the Physician. Upon Mount <i>Golgotha</i> we see Paradise,
lost by the first <i>Adam</i>, regained by the Death of the second
<i>Adam</i>; Principalities and Powers led captives by a dying Man;
there we see Life restored by Death, a Crown of Glory purchased
by an ignominious Cross. Were the <i>Israelites</i> healed by a Creature
made in the Likeness of the Serpent that hurt? So Men are
restor’d by one made like themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>How was this miraculous Cure in the Wilderness obtained?
It was by an ocular View, that is, by looking at the artificial
Serpent. None else were entitled to a Relief. Thus Salvation
comes by Faith, which in the prophetick Dialect is represented by
<i>looking</i>. <i>Es.</i> xlv. 22. <i>Look unto me and be ye saved all the Ends of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the Earth.</i> The first Sin enter’d at the Eye; <i>the Woman saw the
Fruit was good</i>. Thus our Restoration to the Divine Favour is
by an Eye to Christ, the <i>Tree of Life</i>, but I must not strain the
Metaphor too far.</p>

    <div>SECT. IV.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><i>Why was the Cure by a Serpent of Brass?</i> I answer, not for
any healing Virtue inherent in that Mineral, more than others,
but to demonstrate his Almighty Power, who can save by improbable
Means, or without the Application of any Means. Thus
the blind Man was cured by a Piece of Clay temper’d with Spittle;
<i>John</i> ix. 6.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, this also may refer to our Lord, as he is compar’d
to <i>Brass</i>, which, when polish’d, is of a most beautiful
Colour, exceeding that of Gold. <i>Revel.</i> i. 15. <i>His Feet like
unto fine Brass.</i> An Emblem of the high Qualities that glitter in
him, whose Nature is divinely fair and glorious.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those fiery Serpents, as they flew in the Air, might in Colour
resemble that of <i>burnish’d Brass</i>, because the Serpent of <i>Moses</i>
was form’d of <i>Brass</i>, a Metal that in itself is no Friend to Health;
and some have said, that the Sight of the brazen Serpent ought
naturally to increase the Distemper of the Wounded, instead of
healing it; and that the Almighty, shew’d a double Efficacy of
his Power, by healing with those Means, which ought to have a
quite contrary Effect<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c019'><sup>[362]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tho’ Brass in its natural State, may not be propitious to

<p class='c013'>A Certain learned Gentleman of this Island, imagines
that the <i>brazen Serpent</i> was a kind of <i>Talisman</i>; that is to
say, one of those Pieces of Metal, which are cast and engraven
under certain Constellations, from whence they derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>an extraordinary Virtue to cure Distempers, <i>&amp;c.</i> Some impute
their Effects to the old Serpent, others to the Nature of the Metal,
and to the Influence of the Constellation. This Author
therefore would make us believe, that the brazen Serpent cured
just as the <i>Talismans</i> cure certain Distempers, by the Sympathy
there is between the Metals of which they are made, or the Influence
of the Stars under which they are formed, and the Disease
they are to cure. Every one may believe as he pleases<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c019'><sup>[364]</sup></a>.</p>

    <div><i>WHAT became of the brazen Serpent at last?</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I answer, it was brought into the <i>Land of Canaan</i> as a sacred
Relick, and religiously preserved among the <i>Israelites</i> down
to the Time of <i>Hezekiah</i> the King, as a standing Memorial of
divine Goodness to their Forefathers in the Wilderness; but being
abused by them to Superstition and Idolatry, as appears by their
burning Incense thereto, it was broke in pieces by the special
Command of King <i>Hezekiah</i>, who, in Derision and Contempt,
called it <i>Mehushtan</i>, a Piece of Brass, a Trifle, a Bauble, Shadow
of a Snake. 2 <i>Kings</i> xviii. 4.
May all the Ecclesiastical <i>Nehushtans</i> of <i>Babylon</i>, foisted into
Divine Worship, from the Rising of the Sun, to the Going-down
of the same, meet with the same honest and righteous Fate. In
the Church of St. <i>Ambrose</i> at <i>Milan</i>, they pretend to keep a
<i>brazen Serpent</i>, which they shew for that of <i>Moses</i>, tho’ there be
no such thing now in being.
In the Church of St. <i>Ambrose</i> there is a Dragon of Brass on a
Column of Marble: Some think it to be that of <i>Esculapius</i>,
others an Emblem of that in the Wilderness, upon which account
many of the Pilgrims and common People worship it. The Inhabitants
are very superstitious, and fond of holy Fragments, and
pretend to have at the Church of St. <i>Alexander</i>, no less than
144,000 <i>Martyrs</i> from the <i>Catacombs</i> of St. <i>Sebastian</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The Cures effected by the artificial Serpent, derived that
Efficacy from the divine Institution of that Medium: Had their
Prescription been the meer Device of Rabbi <i>Moses</i>, that great and
valuable End would not have been answered; therefore, since the
Reason of that Institution ceased, ’twas highly criminal in them,
to make any religious Use of it.
It is the divine Impress upon Institutions that ushers in the
Blessings intended by them; therefore to hope for Acceptance
with God on account of meer human Ordinances, (as bowing to
Images, to the Altar, to the East, and to make use of Crucifixes,
Crosses, holy Water) is to <i>hope for what God has never promised
to give</i>.
No wonder to see the brazen Serpent ground to Powder, and
the Dust scatter’d in the Air, that so no Fragments of it might
remain, when Altars of divine Establishment, and sacred to Devotion,
were intirely destroy’d, when they made Idols of them:
And how a holy and jealous God may resent the <i>Adoration of
the Cross in the Popish Church</i>, I pretend not to predict, much
less to determine. This Destruction of the brazen Serpent, is
reckon’d among the good Deeds of King <i>Hezekiah</i>, because it
was made a Medium, and Part of Worship not prescrib’d by divine
Authority.</p>

the first Period of which is hard to trace.
Some make <i>Cain</i> the first Founder of it, because of his early
Apostacy from the true Religion; which is not very improbable,
since ’tis said, <i>He went out from the Presence of the Lord....</i>

<p class='c013'>That the old World was guilty of Idolatry, some gather
from <i>Gen.</i> iv. 26. which they say will bear this Reading——<i>Then
Men prophaned, calling on the Name of the Lord, that is, by
setting up Idols</i>: Upon which some of the Rabbins paraphrase
thus, viz. <i>Then they began to call Idols by the Name of the
Lord</i>: With which agrees the <i>Jerusalem Targum</i>, that says, <i>That
was the Age, in the days of which they began to err, and made
themselves Idols, and called their Idols by the Name of the Word of
the Lord</i><a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c019'><sup>[366]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>So they understand <i>Gen.</i> vi. 11. <i>The Earth was corrupt</i>, that
is <i>idolatrous</i>. In defence of this Gloss, they quote the <i>Idolatry</i> of
the <i>golden Calf</i>, which is expressed by this very Form of Speech,
viz. <i>The People had corrupted themselves</i>. We read <i>Gen.</i> iv. 26.
<i>Then Men began to call upon the Name of the Lord</i>. There is no
room to doubt, but they called upon God before; the Particle
<i>then</i> seems to refer to <i>Enos</i>, which is the next Antecedent: therefore
’tis said, They now applied themselves to the Knowledge of
the Stars, which they apprehended were erected for the Government
of the World, and consequently might be their Duty to adore
them as God’s Representatives.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the general Opinion is, that Idolatry did not begin till
after the Deluge, and that perhaps the Deluge might be one Occasion
of it; for the old World, as some suppose, was drown’d
for <i>Atheism</i>——which coming to the Knowledge of <i>Noah</i>’s mediate
Successors, they run into the other Extreme, <i>chusing rather
to have many Gods than no God</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>IDOLATRY</i> is of a more antient Date than <i>Image-Worship</i>:
To see Men kneeling before a piece of Wood or Stone, has
something so low and mean in it, that Men were not immediately
brought to that abject and scandalous piece of Worship. The
Sun, Moon, and Stars, were their <i>natural Gods</i>, and ador’d before
deify’d Men, who were their <i>animated Gods</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Deification of Creatures, seems to begin about the time
of the <i>Confusion at Babel</i>, or the Dispersion immediately consequent
thereupon, particularly in the Family of <i>Nimrod</i>, the Son
of <i>Cush</i>, Grandson of <i>Noah</i>. May not we date the <i>Original of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Paganism</i> from that remarkable Person? ’Tis the Conjecture of
some, that <i>Nimrod</i> was the first Man that was deify’d, and probably
for the important Service he did to his Country, as a <i>mighty
Hunter</i>, in destroying wild Beasts that otherwise would soon have
devour’d the Inhabitants, which were not very numerous in those
days. ’Tis certain, that such Benefactors to Mankind were rank’d
among the Gods. If so, who will pretend to say, <i>our modern
Fox-Hunters don’t carry one Characteristic of Divinity about
them</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'>Some think that the true Religion was universal for about
four hundred Years after the Deluge, because it does not appear
from <i>Abram</i>’s Traverse thro’ <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Canaan</i>, <i>Philistia</i>,
<i>Egypt</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> that those Countries were Idolaters. Others apprehend
<i>Abram</i> himself was originally an Idolater, at least that Idolatry
had overspread the Nations in his time, for which they quote
<i>Joshua</i> xxiv. 2. <i>Your Fathers ... even Terah the Father of Abraham
... served other Gods</i>. It’s evident from hence, that <i>Terah</i>
had fallen into Idolatry, and some are of Opinion, that <i>Abram</i>
himself was an Idolater, till God made him sensible of the Vanity
of Idol-worship, and that it was thro’ him that his Father <i>Terah</i>
was brought under the same Conviction, by this Device, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Jews</i> say that <i>Terah</i> was not only an Idolater, but also a
Carver, and Dealer in Images and Idols; that one day when he
went a Journey, he left <i>Abram</i> to take care of the Shop; but
<i>Abram</i> being already convinced of the Sinfulness of Idols, ask’d
all that came to buy <i>Idol-Gods</i> of him, <i>How old are you?</i> They
told him their Age; and he replied to them, <i>This God that you
would buy and worship, is younger than you are; it was made but
the other day, and of contemptible Matter, therefore believe what I
say, and renounce this vain Worship</i>. The <i>Buyers</i> struck with
Confusion at these Reproaches, went away without buying, asham’d
of their Stupidity<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c019'><sup>[367]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Q. <i>What might move Men to the first Idolatry?</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps it might be a <i>strong Attachment to the Senses</i>, which
they made their sovereign Judges in Spirituals: It was hard for
vulgar Heads in those Days of Darkness to elevate their Thoughts
above sensible Objects.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Another Reason, may be the <i>Pride of the human Mind</i>;
that is not satisfied with rational plain Truths, but will adulterate
them with foolish Imaginations: Hence it was that they
would have such Objects of Worship, as might immediately strike
their sensible Powers; nothing would serve their Turn but a Divinity
visible to the Eye, therefore they brought down the Gods
to the Earth, and represented them under certain Images, which
by degrees commenced inferior Deities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Egyptian Priests</i> not being able to persuade the <i>People</i>,
that there were any <i>Gods</i> or <i>Spirits</i> superior to Men, were constrained
to call down Demons, or Spirits, and lodge them in Statues,
and then bring forth those Statues to be visible Objects of
Adoration, and from hence sprung Idolatry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the Pagans were various Opinions about religious
Images. <i>Some</i> looked upon them as only Representatives of the
true God, as <i>Seneca</i>, a Stoick Philosopher, and <i>Plato</i> a Native of
<i>Athens</i>, and a noted Academick.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>OTHERS</i> said, they did not adore material Images, but the
Gods in them, into which they were drawn by virtue of their
Consecration, or, in a more modern Language, their Canonization<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c019'><sup>[368]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>SOME</i> were of Opinion, that after the Consecration of Images,
the Gods actually incorporated with them, or were animated
by them, as Man’s Body is by the Soul<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c019'><sup>[369]</sup></a>. The vulgar
Heathen paid their Adoration to Images as if they were real Gods;

controverted. The <i>Lutherans</i> condemn the <i>Calvinists</i> for breaking
the Images in the Churches of the Catholicks; and at the

as Idolaters. The modern <i>Jews</i> condemn all Images,
and suffer no Pictures or Figures in their Houses, much
less in their Synagogues, or Places of Worship.</p>

    <div>I. <i>MEN transformed into Gods.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I Begin with their <i>deified Men</i>, that is, <i>dead Men</i>, who being
canonized, past for <i>reputed Gods</i>. Note here, some are of
opinion, that the word <i>God</i>, among the Heathen, did not mean
the uncreated eternal Being, but some <i>most excellent superior Nature</i>;
and accordingly, they gave the Appellation of <i>Gods</i> to <i>all
Beings</i> of a Rank higher, and more perfect than Man.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>principal Gods</i> among the antient Heathens were <i>Jupiter</i>,
<i>Mars</i>, <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Neptune</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Juno</i>, <i>Vesta</i>, <i>Minerva</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
The <i>next sort of Gods</i> were called <i>Demy-Gods</i>, or <i>Gods adopted</i>;
and these were Men canonized and deify’d. Now, as the <i>greater
Gods</i> had possession of Heaven in their <i>own Right</i>, so these <i>lesser
Gods</i> had it by <i>Donation</i>, being translated into Heaven, because
they were Men renowned for their Virtues, and had lived as Gods
upon Earth; and these at first were called <i>Teraphim</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first certain Account of these we have in <i>Genesis</i>, where
’tis said, <i>Rachel</i> had <i>stoln her Father’s Images</i>. Chap. xxxi. 19.
the <i>Teraphim</i> of her Father in the <i>Hebrew</i>, which <i>Laban</i>, (ii. 30.)
calls his <i>Gods</i>, Hebr. <i>Eloha</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The word <i>Teraphim</i> is <i>Hebrew</i>, others say <i>Egyptian</i>: Be that
as it will, we find it about thirteen times in our Bible, and is
commonly interpreted <i>Idols</i>, <i>Images</i>, <i>sacred</i>, <i>superstitious Figures</i>.
<i>Spencer</i> maintains the word to be <i>Chaldee</i>, and that those Images
were borrowed from the <i>Amorites</i>, <i>Chaldeans</i>, or <i>Syrians</i>, and
that the <i>Egyptian Serapis</i> is the same thing with <i>Teraphim</i> of the
<i>Chaldeans</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Learned <i>Jew</i> says the <i>Teraphim</i> were in human Shape,
and that when raised upright, they spoke at certain Hours, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>under certain Constellations, by the Influence of the celestial Bodies.
<i>R. David de Pomis ... Cyclopædia.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>This <i>Rabbinical Fable</i> seems to be grounded on <i>Zech.</i> x. 2.
<i>The Idols</i> (Hebr. <i>Teraphim</i>) <i>have spoken Vanity....</i> Some of the
learned <i>Jews</i> will have it to denote the Knowledge of Futurity,
and for this Signification they quote <i>Ezek.</i> xxi. 21. <i>The King of
Babylon stood ... at the Head of the two Ways ... he consulted with
Images</i>; with <i>Teraphim</i>, says the <i>Hebrew</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same <i>Rabbi</i> adds, that to make the <i>Teraphim</i> they kill’d
a first-born Child, clove his Head, season’d it with Salt and Oil;
that they wrote on a Plate of Gold the Name of some impure
Spirit, laid it under the Tongue of the Dead, placed the Head
against the Wall, lighted Lamps before it, prayed to it, and it
talk’d with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Others hold, that the <i>Teraphim</i> were brazen Instruments
which pointed out the Hours of future Events, as directed by
the Stars.—Some think that the <i>Teraphim</i> were Figures or Images
of a Star engraven on a sympathetic Stone, or Metal corresponding
to the Star, in order to receive its Influences: To these Figures,
under certain Aspects of the Stars, they ascribe extraordinary
Effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Talismanical Opinion, says a Learned Pen<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c019'><sup>[371]</sup></a>, appears the
most probable.... All the Eastern People are still much addicted
to this Superstition of <i>Talismans</i>. The <i>Persians</i> call them <i>Telesin</i>,
a Word approaching to <i>Teraphim</i>. In those Countries no Man is
seen without them, and some are even loaded with them. They
hang them to the Necks of Animals, and Cages of Birds, as Preservatives
against Evils. Such were the <i>Samothracian Talismans</i>,
which were pieces of Iron, formed into certain Images and set in
Rings....</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Labanic Images</i> are supposed to be the most antient, if
not the first religious Images, made of some precious Metal, and
had their Birth in <i>Laban</i>’s Country, that is, <i>Chaldea</i>, or <i>Mesopotamia</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>From <i>Laban</i>’s History, it seems as if these <i>Teraphim</i> were
Pictures or Images of certain Persons deceased; that is, they were
a sort of Idols, or superstitious Figures venerated by them as
<i>Demy-Gods</i>. That they were such artificial Portraitures of Men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>is evident from that Instance in <i>Michal</i>, who, to deliver <i>David</i>
her Husband from bloody Assassins that threaten’d his Life, laid an
<i>Image in his Bed</i>, a <i>Teraphim</i>, says the <i>Hebrew</i>, that is, a material
Image, probably a Figure of Wood, or Sticks hastily made
up, drest in Man’s Clothes, to make those sent by King <i>Saul</i>
to apprehend him, believe he was sick.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why does <i>Laban</i> call them his Gods? Very probably because
he believed they retain’d their Affection for Mankind in the invisible
World, and being rank’d among the Gods, might be serviceable
to his Family, therefore adopted them to be Guardians
of his House. They were only his <i>domestick Gods</i>, and not the
established Gods of the Country; and ’tis very likely they might
be the Images of <i>Noah</i> and his <i>Sons</i>; or some other illustrious
Ancestors, whom he had chosen for his <i>Tutelary Gods</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Scripture mentions another sort of <i>Teraphim</i>, sometimes
consulted by the <i>Jews</i> as an Oracle, not imagining that thereby
they abandon’d the Worship of the true God. Such was the
<i>Teraphim</i> that <i>Micha</i> made and set up in his House, and to which
he appointed a <i>Priest</i> of the <i>Levitical Race</i>, with an <i>Ephod</i> or
Sacramental Garment, by the Influence of which he flatter’d himself
that God would bless his House. This probably might be
some <i>Hieroglyphical Figure</i>, to which the superstitious <i>Jews</i> attributed
the Virtue of an Oracle, and the Power of foretelling
Things to come: Hence speaking Teraphims.</p>

<p class='c013'>From these <i>Teraphim</i> came the <i>Lares</i>, or the Household Gods
of the old <i>Romans</i>, who before the Laws of the Twelve Tables,
used to bury the Dead in their Houses; from whence arose that
great Veneration they had for their <i>Lares</i> and <i>Penates</i>, a kind of
domestick Divinities, worship’d in Houses, and esteem’d Protectors
of Families, which were nothing else but the supposed
Ghosts of those who formerly had belonged to the Family, whom
they represented by Images, which they placed in the Chimney-Corner,
or near their Doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were also look’d upon as Guardians of the Highways,
near to which their Images were fix’d for the Benefit of Travellers,
therefore call’d <i>Dii Viales</i>, Gods of the Roads. ’Tis said by the
Prophet, <i>The King of Babylon stood at the parting of the Way</i>, and
consulted <i>with the Images</i>; with the <i>Teraphim</i>, says the <i>Hebrew</i>,
<i>Ezek.</i> xxi. 21. which the <i>Jewish</i> Interpreters say were prophetick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Images, endued with the Gift of Prediction; so far from being
mere Idols, that they gave out Oracles, and foretold Things to
come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some think <i>Laban</i>’s <i>Teraphim</i> to be such, and that <i>Rachel</i>,
having observed how her Father did divine by them, and fearing,
by consulting with them, he might know which way <i>Jacob</i> went,
and follow after and murder him; to prevent so fatal a Catastrophe,
she took away his <i>Oracles</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those sacred Images might, at first, be made in honour of
departed Relatives, or illustrious Persons; but by degrees degenerated
into religious Adoration. Thus the <i>Manes</i> of the Dead
were worship’d by them under the Figure of their <i>Teraphim</i>, in
some place of the House, and probably where they had deposited
the Remains of their Ancestors, as some think.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Lares</i> were also called <i>Penates</i>: To these they paid religious
Homage with Sacrifices; so the <i>Roman Satirist</i> says, and
calls these images his <i>dear little House-Gods</i>; and then observes,
that they were crown’d with Garlands of Flowers in Summer,
and in Winter with Shaving of Horns colour’d. To these <i>Waxen-Gods</i>
the <i>Romans</i> addrest themselves with Offerings of Frankincense
and Cakes<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c019'><sup>[372]</sup></a>....</p>

<p class='c013'>These are the same with <i>Larvæ</i>, which the Antients imagined

plague the bad. All these were imagin’d to be the Ghosts of the
Dead: They pray’d to the Good for Protection, and sacrificed to
the Evil to pacify their Rage: For this reason they had their
<i>Lemuria</i> or <i>Lemuralia</i> at <i>Rome</i>, where on the 9th of <i>May</i>, a Feast

<p class='c013'>We are not without some Remains of those antient Representations:
Among the various Rarities in the <i>Musæum</i> at <i>Leyden</i> in
<i>Holland</i>, is the Effigies in Sculpture of <i>Osiris</i>, the <i>Egyptian God</i>;
’tis made of Wood, and now almost consum’d with Age: There
are three other <i>Egyptian</i> Idols of Stone; an Image of <i>Isis</i> (who
married <i>Osiris</i>, King of the Country) giving suck to her Orr.
Another Effigies of <i>Isis</i>, the <i>Egyptian Goddess</i>, upon a little <i>Egyptian</i>
Coffer, containing the Heart of an <i>Egyptian</i> Prince embalm’d
therein.</p>

<p class='c013'>The antient Pagans, had almost as many <i>Goddesses</i> as <i>Gods</i>;
such were <i>Juno</i>, the <i>Goddess of Air</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Queen of Heaven, and
of the Gods; was represented sitting on a Throne with a Crown
of Gold on her Head: This was the Patroness of the female Sex.
Every Woman had her <i>Juno</i>, or Guardian; as every Man had
his <i>Genius</i>. She was the Goddess of Marriages, which were not
deem’d lawful without the Parties first addrest her. One Branch
of her Office was to attend them in Labor, when they pray’d,
<i>Help, Juno Lucina</i><a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c019'><sup>[378]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>She was ador’d by all Nations; her Temple was open on the
Top and had no Doors, it being impious to think of confining
the Gods to a narrow Inclosure. Yea, many of the Antients
would erect no devotional Temples, from a Persuasion that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>whole World is the Temple of God. The <i>Sicyonians</i> would build
no Temple to their Goddess <i>Coronis</i>: Nor would the <i>Athenians</i>
erect a Statue to the Goddess <i>Clemency</i>, who they said was to live
in the <i>Hearts of Men</i>, not <i>within Stone-Walls</i>. The Goddesses
were numerous, but I shall add no more.</p>

<p class='c013'>They did not only enroll <i>Men</i> and <i>Women</i> among their Gods,
but they had also <i>Hermaphrodite-Gods</i>. Thus <i>Minerva</i>, according
to several of the Learned, was both Man and Woman, and
worshipped as such under the Appellation of <i>Lunus &amp; Luna</i>.
<i>Mithras</i>, the <i>Persian Deity</i>, was both God and Goddess; there
were Gods of Virtue, Vice, Time, Place, Death ... Infancy.
Not Men only, but every thing that relates to Mankind, has also
been deified, as Infancy, Age, Death, Labor, Rest, Sleep, Virtues,
Vices, Time, Place.... Infancy alone had a numerous Train of
Deities. They also ador’d the Gods of Health, Love, Fear, Pain,
Indignation, Shame, Renown, Prudence, Art, Science, Fidelity,
Liberty, Money, War, Peace, Victory....</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus we have seen, that nothing more common among Pagans,
than to place Men among the Number of Deities; yea,
some of them would not wait for their Deification till Death.
Thus <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, King of <i>Babylon</i>, procured his <i>Image to
be worshipped</i> while he was living. Thus <i>Augustus</i> had Altars
erected and Sacrifices offered to him while alive. He had Priests
called <i>Augustales</i>, and Temples at <i>Lyons</i>, and several other Places.
He was the first <i>Roman</i> who carried Idolatry to such a pitch:
Having in a most respectful manner view’d the embalm’d Body
of <i>Alexander the Great</i>, was ask’d, if he would see <i>Ptolemy</i>’s also?
he answer’d, <i>His Curiosity was to see a King, not a Man</i>. His
Favourite Poet complements him with the Title of God<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c019'><sup>[379]</sup></a>. Yea,

<p class='c033'>II. <i>Inanimate Things turn’d into Gods.</i>
Things without Life were made into Gods by the Heathens:
The Sun, Moon, and Stars seem to be the first Idols, or false
Gods, to whom they paid a divine Regard. <i>Possidonius</i> defines a
<i>Star</i>, a <i>divine Body</i>. The <i>Zabii</i> erected Images to the Stars,
which they fancied to be so many Gods, and that they influenced
the Images consecrated to them; yea, and communicated the prophetick
Spirit to Men.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> were by the idolatrous <i>Israelites</i> called the
<i>King</i> and <i>Queen</i> of Heaven, and the Stars were supposed (as it
were) to be their Militia, form’d for their Guards, with which
they were always surrounded.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>PHILO</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, (called <i>Philo</i> the <i>Jew</i>, a <i>Platonick</i>
Philosopher) imputes to the Stars a great part of whatever happens
on the Earth; and says, they are not only Animals, but even
most pure Spirits; that our Air is replete with Animals and Spirits,
which are continually descending to animate Bodies. He
had borrow’d these odd Notions from his Master <i>Plato</i>, Chief of
the Academicks. <i>Origen</i> one of the Fathers, who flourish’d in
the third Century, was guilty of the same Mistake<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c019'><sup>[380]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sacred Books, in some places, seem to ascribe Knowledge
to the <i>Stars</i>, when they praised God at the beginning of the
World, <i>Job</i> xxxviii. 7. but the Stars were not then created, therefore
it’s generally supposed they were <i>Angels</i>. Since then the Sun,
Moon and Stars are excited to praise the Lord; the Moon withdrew
its Light, and the Sun stopt its Course at the Command of
<i>Joshua</i> ... and perhaps one reason of their strange Opinions about
the heavenly Bodies, might be owing to these and the like Expressions;
not knowing that these Words were meerly popular,
and not to be understood literally, for then we must say that the
Earth, the Trees, the Waters, are animated, since we find in
Scripture some Expressions that would insinuate as much.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Arabians</i> who sprung from <i>Ishmael</i>, worshipped the Sun,
Moon and Stars, in which they were conducted by their Priests
who were cloathed in white Vestments, wearing Mitres and
Sandals, which at first were only Soles tied to the Feet with Strings.
In Authors that speak of ecclesiastical Rites, and Ornaments,
we find the word <i>Sandals</i> to signify a valuable kind of Shoes,
worn by the <i>Prelates at Solemnities</i><a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c019'><sup>[381]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>We find <i>Sandals</i> also used by the Ladies, very different in
form: When <i>Judith</i> went to the Camp of <i>Holofernes</i>, she put
<i>Sandals</i> on her Feet, at the sight of which he was captivated;
for ’tis said, <i>Her Sandals ravish’d his Eyes</i>. These were a magnificent
sort of Stockens, like Buskins, of an extraordinary Beauty<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c019'><sup>[382]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>and were proper only to the Ladies of Condition, who generally

rais’d on Soals of Cork, wore by the ancient Actors in Tragedy,
to make them appear taller, and more like the Heroes they represented,
most of whom were supposed to be Giants.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Persians</i> had no Temples, Altars, nor Images, holding
such little Things improper for the high Gods. Therefore they
worshipp’d upon the Top of Hills, where they offer’d Sacrifices
to the Sun, Moon, and Stars. The <i>Babylonians</i> adored the
Sun, to which the King offer’d every Day a white Horse
richly furnish’d: The Sun was in high Esteem among the <i>Phenicians</i>,
whose Priests were crown’d with Gold. The <i>Tartars</i> and
<i>Cathaians</i> worship the Sun, and Stars, to which they offer the first
Fruits of their Meat every Morning before they eat and drink
themselves. They have divers Monasteries of Idols, to whom
they dedicate their Children.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Nova Zembla</i> there is no Religion prescrib’d by Law, but
they worship the <i>Sun</i>, so long as ’tis with them, and the Moon
and North-Star in its absence. In <i>China</i> are great Numbers of
sacred Temples, where the Priests have so much Power over their
Gods, that they may beat them when they don’t answer their
Expectation: Their <i>chief</i> Gods are the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Moon</i>, and <i>Stars</i>,
where they are not christianis’d.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>Philippine Islands</i>, the Natives worship the <i>Stars</i>,
which they hold to be the <i>Children</i> of the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>: Their
Priests, for the most part, are Women. The <i>Japonians</i> worship
an Image, with three Faces, by which they mean, Sun, Moon,

<p class='c013'>In <i>America</i> their chief Deities are the Sun and Moon; which
they honour with Dances and Songs. In <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Florida</i>,
when they eat, drink, and sacrifice, they use to throw up towards
the Sun, some part of their Food: The <i>Spaniards</i> taking
Advantage of this Superstition, made the poor ignorant People
believe they were Messengers sent to them from the Sun; whereupon
they submitted to the <i>Spanish</i> Yoke. <i>Hacluyt</i>, <i>ibid.</i> At
<i>Mexico</i>, when they sacrificed a Man, they pull’d out his <i>Heart</i>,
and offer’d it to the <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>In <i>South-America</i>, they worship evil Spirits in various Forms,
and Sun and Moon. When it thunders, and lightens, they say
the <i>Sun</i> is angry with them: When the Moon is eclipsed, they say
the <i>Sun</i> is angry with her.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Peru</i>, next to their chief God, they worship’d the Sun,
and after it, the Thunder. They took Sun and Moon for Husband
and Wife. In the seventh Month they sacrificed to the Sun,
and in the tenth to the Honour of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same Paganism was profest among the <i>Europeans</i>; yea
the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i> that were the most knowing and polite Nations,
their chief Gods were Sun, Moon, and Stars.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Air, and Meteors in it, were made into Gods: Thus
the <i>Persians</i> ador’d the Wind; Thunder and Lightning were honour’d
under the Name <i>Geryon</i>. Comets and the Rainbow also
have been prefer’d from <i>Meteors</i>, to be <i>Gods</i>. <i>Socrates</i> deify’d the
Clouds, if Credit may be given to <i>Aristophanes</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their high Veneration for <i>Water</i> was such, that to spit, to
urine, or wash in a River was made a high Crime; perhaps, the
<i>Water of Jealousy</i> that determin’d the Case about the <i>Jewish</i> Women,
suspected of Adultery, might heighten their Veneration for
this Element.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Sicily</i>, Rivers were worshipped by the <i>Agrigentes</i> (in the
shape of a beautiful Boy) to which they sacrificed.... The <i>Cathaians</i>
worship Earth and Water.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Indians</i> count the River <i>Ganges</i> sacred, and to have a
Power of expiating their Sins. When the Idolaters wash in it,
they cry, <i>Oh Ganges, purify me!</i> And when any are sick, they dip
them in it, in order to recover their Health. The Water of this
River is convey’d to such as live at a distance, and are not in a
Capacity to travel; so that they ascribe as much Virtue to this
River, as the Papists do to their holy Water, and chief Relicks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The People of <i>Bengal</i> don’t only worship the River <i>Ganges</i>,
but give Divine Honours to its Image. <i>Bernier</i> says, that Kingdom
is well water’d by Channels cut out of the <i>Ganges</i>, which is
visited by many Pilgrims, who think themselves happy if they
can wash in it. There is also a Well in that Country, which
they adore, and think, by washing therein, they are purify’d from
their Sins. Their <i>Priests</i> travel about with the <i>Water</i> of the
<i>Ganges</i>, which they sell at vast Prices; because the poor ignorant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>People are made to believe, that by drinking this Water, they
obtain Pardon of their Sins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Inhabitants of <i>Peru</i> in <i>America</i>, fling the Ashes of their
Sacrifices into the River, follow the same six Leagues, and pray
the River to bring that Present to <i>Virachoca</i>, a superior Deity.

<p class='c013'>The <i>Persians</i> and <i>Chaldeans</i> express their God by <i>Fire</i>, to
which they perform Adoration, and bring it Food, crying to
it, <i>Eat, Oh my Lord Fire!</i> To throw dead and dirty Things
into the Fire, yea to blow it with their Breath, was High Treason.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Magicians</i> say, that this <i>Fire</i> was convey’d to them from
Heaven; and that it was for this Reason that they kept it so religiously.
That they preserve a constant Fire on their Altars, is
evident from History. They are said to have Fires still subsisting,
which have burnt above a thousand Years. We read of such Fire
kept up with superstitious Care in the Temple of <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>,
and in that of <i>Hercules</i> at <i>Gades</i>. So it is in <i>Egypt</i>, and in most
of all the eastern Countries, and <i>Virgil</i> tells that <i>Iarbas</i> the <i>Getulian</i>
could boast of a hundred Temples he had erected with
Altars, blazing with perpetual Fire, the eternal Guard of the

<p class='c031'>That which gave occasion to perpetuate the Fire in Pagan

express, to keep up the sacred Fire of the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Kings of <i>Persia</i> never went abroad without having some
Portion of the sacred Fire carried before them: The Historian
giving an Account of the March of <i>Darius</i>’s Army,—says, that

they had it in great Veneration, calling it the <i>sacred and eternal
Fire</i>, and that the <i>Magi</i> came after, singing Hymns according to

<p class='c013'>God appear’d to <i>Moses</i> under the Form of a Fire burning in

in the Night by a Pillar of Fire. Now God having made several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Revelations of himself, under the Appearance of Fire, might give
occasion to the <i>Chaldeans</i> and <i>Persians</i> to entertain such enormous
Veneration for Fire, which is a Symbol of the Deity: <i>The Lord
thy God</i>, says <i>Moses, is a consuming Fire</i>. At their high Solemnities
they set several Trees (hung with diverse Sorts of Beasts for
Sacrifice) on fire; this they did after they had carried about
these Fires in Procession.</p>

<p class='c013'>I Shall add here, a remarkable Contest that happen’d between
the <i>Chaldean</i> and <i>Egyptian</i> Priests about the <i>Superiority of
their Gods</i>.... In the time of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Chaldean Priests</i>, to
prove that <i>Fire</i>, which was their God, excell’d all other Gods
in Power, travell’d over the Earth, carrying <i>Fire</i> with them,
which soon consum’d all the Statues and Images of other Gods;
whether of Brass, Silver, Stone or Wood, says <i>Suidas</i><a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c019'><sup>[386]</sup></a>, who
gives a large Account of it, under the Word κανωπος. At length
coming into <i>Egypt</i>, and making this Challenge; the <i>Egyptian
Priests</i> agreed upon a <i>Battle of the Gods</i>, and immediately brought
into the Field one of their Idols, which was a large Statue of
<i>Nilus, full of Water</i>, and full of little Holes, which they stopt
with Wax not discernable, and so artificially, that the Water
was kept in.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Chaldeans</i> (not aware of this Device) begun the Action,
with much Assurance, and with Eagerness put Fire around the
<i>Egyptian Statue</i>, which soon melted the invisible Wax, and the
Water gushing forth from all Parts, immediately put out the Fire,
and drown’d the hitherto <i>invincible Deity</i> of the <i>Persians</i>; the
Tragedy ended in a triumphant Shout of Laughter among the
Spectators: And I might add<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c019'><sup>[387]</sup></a> how the <i>Arabians</i> and <i>Indians</i>,
<i>Peruvians</i>, <i>Lithuanians</i>, and <i>Vandals</i> worship’d Vegetables,—the
<i>Scythians</i> Iron. Trees and Plants have been made Gods.
Leeks and Onions were Deities in <i>Egypt</i>. The ancient <i>Gauls</i>
and <i>Britons</i> bore a particular Devotion to the <i>Oak</i>; from which
their Priests took their Names. <i>Ceres</i> and <i>Proserpina</i>, worship’d
by the Ancients, were no other than Wheat, Corn, Seed.—The
<i>Syrians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i> ador’d Fishes. What were <i>Tritons</i>, <i>Nereids</i>,
<i>Syrens</i>, but Sea-Gods? Insects, as Flies, and Ants, had their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Priests and Votaries: Yea, <i>Minerals</i> were erected into <i>Deities</i>.
The <i>Finlanders</i> ador’d <i>Stones</i>. I don’t see what can be said for
such an Instance of Stupidity. To say the Practice took its rise
from <i>Abram</i>’s anointing the <i>Stone</i> that he made use of for a Pillow,
when he went to <i>Mesopotamia</i>, does not lessen the Reproach.
The <i>Mahometans</i> think that <i>Jacob</i>’s Stone was convey’d to the
<i>Temple at Jerusalem</i>; and is still there in a <i>Mosque</i> or <i>Turkish</i>
Temple, where the Temple at <i>Jerusalem</i> stood before the final
Desolation. The monstrous Stupidity of Pagans in their Devotions
will further appear in the Close of this Performance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now among all these Instances of Idolatry, the Adoration of
the <i>Sun</i> was the most excusable; for, who can behold that stupendous
Globe of Fire and Light in perpetual Motion, Splendor,
and universal Usefulness to Mankind, without awful Admiration,
and warm Emotions of Mind? No wonder then to find that it has
been the Object of Adoration so long, and in so many Places. It
was the Sun very probably that was worship’d by the <i>Phenicians</i>
under the Name of <i>Baal</i>, by the <i>Moabites</i> under the Name of
<i>Chemosh</i>, by the <i>Ammonites</i> under the Name of <i>Moloch</i>; by the
degenerated <i>Israelites</i> by the Name of <i>Baal</i>, the King of the Host
of Heaven, to whom they join’d the Moon, whom they called
<i>Astarta</i> or Queen of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Worship was perform’d upon high Places, in Groves,
and upon the Roofs of their Houses, which in those Countries,
were flat. It was against this kind of Worship that <i>Moses</i> warn’d
the <i>Israelites</i>, and threatens the Transgressors with Death. <i>Deut.</i>
iv. 19, ’tis said <i>Josiah</i> King of <i>Judah took away the Horses</i>, that his
Royal Predecessors had given to the Sun, and were fix’d at the
Entrance into the House of the Lord, and <i>burnt the Chariots of
the Sun with Fire</i>.</p>

<p class='c033'>III. <i>Animal Gods.</i>
In the next place, I shall briefly touch upon some Brutes and
Birds, <i>&amp;c.</i> that received Divine Honours from the Pagan People,
and even from those who were supposed to excel their Neighbours
in Understanding and Wisdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus <i>Crocodiles</i>, <i>Serpents</i>, <i>Eagles</i>, <i>Dogs</i>, <i>Cats</i>, <i>Wolves</i>, <i>Oxen</i>,
were worship’d by the People of <i>Egypt</i>, those celebrated Sons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>of Wisdom; but their greatest Solemnities were consecrated to
the God <i>Apis</i>, or <i>Serapis</i>, under the Image of an Ox or Bull.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had an Ox consecrated to the Sun, which they fed at
<i>Heliopolis</i> in <i>Egypt</i>: They had another called <i>Apis</i>, dedicated to
the Moon, and fed at <i>Memphis</i>, (for some time, the royal City)
where he had his Temple, and the Devils gave out their Oracles.
In the time of St. <i>Jerom</i>, who flourish’d in the fourth Century,
they worshipped here a brass Bull as a God.</p>

<p class='c013'>The famous God <i>Osiris</i> was adored under the Figure of this
Beast, and when dead, it was buried with great Solemnity and
Mourning: And ’tis observable, that his Birth-day was celebrated
thro’ the whole Kingdom. <i>N. B.</i> ’Tis very probable, that the
<i>Israelites</i> worshipped the golden Calf in the same manner as the
<i>Egyptians</i> did their Bulls, their Cows and Calves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I proceed, give me leave to speak something of this
golden Idol, which was the Figure of a Calf, which the <i>Israelites</i>
cast, and set up to worship in <i>Moses</i>’s Absence; who, upon
his return from the Mount, burnt the Figure, ground it to Powder,
and made the People drink it mixt with Water, <i>Exod.</i> xxxii.
The Learned are divided in their Sentiments on this Article; that
is, the golden Calf, that was burnt and pulverized.</p>

<p class='c013'>To pulverize Gold and render it potable, is an Operation in
Chymistry of the last Difficulty; and ’tis hard to conceive how
it should be done at that time, before Chymistry was heard of,
and in a Wilderness too, where they had no proper Instruments.
Many therefore suppose it to be done by a Miracle. But the chymical
Art seems to be of greater Antiquity, and was very probably
practised in the antediluvian World by <i>Tubal Cain</i>. <i>Moses</i>
is the next Chymist mention’d in the Bible, whose Skill in
chymical Operations, in pulverizing the golden Calf, seems to be
incontestable, and artificial.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Art is now much improved. Bid a Chymist convert
Gold into Glass; and by means of a burning Concave, or otherwise,
he presently does it: Ask him to Shew you Gold in Powder,
and by mixing a little <i>Antimony</i> with that Metal, he will soon
render it pulverable<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c019'><sup>[388]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>But to return: Among other living Creatures, the <i>Egyptians</i>
also paid a great Devotion to <i>Dogs</i> and <i>Cats</i>. We read of a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span><i>Roman</i> Soldier, that was like to be torn to pieces by the People,
for having <i>kill’d a Cat by Accident</i>; and that when a Dog

<p class='c013'>The City of <i>Mendez</i> in <i>Egypt</i> worshipped a <i>Goat</i>; the City
of <i>Mira</i>, the <i>Crocodile</i>. In other Provinces they erected Altars
to Lions, Baboons, Wolves.... The <i>Hog</i> was ador’d in the Island
of <i>Crete</i> (now <i>Candy</i>) in the Mediterranean. Bats and Mice
had Altars consecrated to them in <i>Troas</i> and at <i>Tenedos</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing can be supposed more ridiculous than the Adoration
given by the <i>Egyptians</i> to their brutal Deities, which were
either within or near their Temples; had Tables with delicious
Meats and Beds prepared for them, and when any of them died,
they went into Mourning, prepared sumptuous Funerals and
magnificent Tombs for them, as may be seen at large in <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i>, <i>Herodotus</i>, and others<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c019'><sup>[390]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some indeed ridiculed their senseless and stupid Neighbours,
tho’ they themselves were not Masters of superior Sense in their
Devotions. <i>Anaxandrides</i> reproaches the <i>Egyptians</i> for their
wretched and foolish Idolatry; but after all, this was only one
Idolater deriding another. <i>Dionysius</i> was the most notorious this
way: And most knavish in this kind was the <i>Painter</i>, who,
when he should have drawn the Picture of <i>such a Goddess</i> for a
<i>Grecian</i> City, drew the <i>Picture of his own Mistress</i>, and so made
her to be adored by the Citizens.</p>

<p class='c013'>What Man could have forbore laughing, said the <i>Greek</i>
Poet above, to see an <i>Egyptian on his Marrowbones, praying to an
Ox as to a God, or howling over a sick Cat, fearing lest his scratching
God should die</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the whole, ’tis no easy matter to discover the real Sentiments
of the Heathens about their Gods: they admitted so many
superior and inferior Deities, who shared the Empire, that all
was full of Gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the Antients say, that a certain <i>subtile Matter</i> that
made Stars <i>intelligent</i>, did reside in their sacred Animals, Plants

</div>

<p class='c013'>The next thing that comes under Consideration is, the <i>Worship
of Serpents, which is observed thro’ all the Pagan Antiquity</i>.
The Devil, who, under the Shape of a Serpent, tempted our
first Parents, has, with unwearied Application, labour’d to deify
that Animal, as a Trophy of his first Victory over Mankind.
The Conquest made by the <i>old Serpent in Paradise</i>, and the wonderful
Cures made by the <i>Shadow of a Serpent in the Wilderness</i>,
contributed very much towards making that hateful Creature so
venerable in the Eyes of so many Nations.</p>

<p class='c013'>God having past Sentence upon the Serpent, Satan <i>consecrates
that Form</i> in which he deceived the Woman, and introduces it
into the World as an Object of religious Veneration: This he did
with a view to enervate the Force of the divine Oracle, the
Seed of the Woman. Scarcely a Nation upon Earth, but he has
tempted to the grossest Idolatry, and in particular got himself to
be worshipped in the hideous <i>Form of a Serpent</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Almighty foreseeing this general Delusion, guarded the
World against it, by inspiring Men with the greatest Aversion to
that venemous Creature, and yet was the Tempter ador’d in most
places under the Appearance of a Serpent. If you say, that Men
worship other Creatures; I answer, Those are beneficial to Mankind,
and not so odious and hurtful as those who carry Poison
in their Tails and Teeth.</p>

<p class='c013'>How surprizing this! that a Serpent, a Beast to which Mankind
has a strong natural Aversion, should be <i>ador’d by Creatures
of Reason</i>, and yet <i>nothing more common</i>, as will appear by the following
Instances from Antiquity.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>EGYPT</i> was a Country that abounded with Variety of Serpents,
and where they were generally held in the greatest Veneration.
The supreme God was represented by them in the <i>Form</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of a <i>Serpent</i> with a Hawk’s Head, because of the wonderful
Agility of that Bird. We see no Table of <i>Osiris</i> and <i>Isis</i>, two
<i>Egyptian Idols</i>, without a Serpent joined to them<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c019'><sup>[392]</sup></a>. This <i>Isis</i>
married <i>Osiris</i>, King of that Country, and govern’d with so
much Wisdom and Gentleness, that the <i>Egyptians</i> paid divine
Honours to them, who had been such Blessings to the Land.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Egypt</i> is a Serpent of the Aspick Kind, called <i>Thermutis</i>,
to which they gave divine Worship; therefore crown’d with it
the Statue of their Goddess <i>Isis</i>. In the Corners of the Temples,
they built little Chapels under ground, where they carefully fed
this <i>Thermutic Serpent</i>, as a <i>sacred Genius</i><a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c019'><sup>[393]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Egyptians</i> also paid divine Honours to the <i>Crocodile</i>, that
monstrous kind of Serpent, particularly the Inhabitants of <i>Arsinoë</i>,
and they who dwelt in the Neighbourhood of <i>Thebes</i>, and the
Lake <i>Mæris</i>; among whom ’twas fed by their Priests with Bread,

<p class='c013'>They represented the World by a Circle, in the middle of
which was a Serpent, representing the good Demon, or Genius
of the World, by which ’tis animated, and is a <i>Symbol</i> of the
Almighty Creator. Behold here the Blasphemy of Satan, in
giving to God the Form of a Serpent, which he had borrow’d
himself to make war against God in Paradise. They sometimes
represented their Gods with the Bodies of Serpents, and honour’d
those odious Animals with divine Worship, as Symbols of <i>Apollo</i>,
of the <i>Sun</i>, and of <i>Medicine</i>, and were put into the Charge of
<i>Ceres</i> and <i>Proserpine</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>HERODOTUS</i> observes, that in his time, near <i>Thebes</i>,
there were to be seen tame Serpents, adorn’d with Jewels, and
consecrated to <i>Jupiter</i>, which did no harm to any body: When
they died, they were buried in <i>Jupiter</i>’s Temple<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c019'><sup>[396]</sup></a>. <i>Ælian</i> speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>of domestick Serpents, that were in the Houses of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
and look’d upon as <i>household Gods</i>; and of another Serpent worshipped
in a Tower at <i>Melitus</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, that had a Priest and
other Officers attending it, and served every day upon an Altar
with Meal kneaded up with Honey, which the next day was
found to be eaten. <i>In Melite Eg. Draco divinis honoribus afficitur

</div>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Phenicians</i> also sacrificed to <i>Dragons</i>, calling them their
<i>good Angels</i>, their propitious and kind Spirits. Nothing more
common in the Heathen Religion, than the Appearance of a Serpent
in some Form or other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Babylonians</i> worshipped a <i>Dragon</i>, which the Prophet
<i>Daniel</i>, by a Commission from the King, killed; which, one
would think, was sufficient to convince the Royal Idolater of his
egregious Stupidity in worshipping a Creature as Conservator of
Mankind, that could not preserve its own Life. They represented
the World by a Circle in the Form of a <i>Greek Theta</i> Θ, and the
<i>good Demon</i>, by a <i>Serpent</i> in the midst of it; under which Figure,
the Protectors of Countries and Cities, called tutelary Gods, were
worshipped.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Arabians</i> reputed Serpents <i>sacred Beings</i>, and therefore
would allow no Violence to be offered to them; and this Superstition
yet remains among those People, according to <i>Veslingius</i>,
says my Author. They take them into their Houses, feed and
worship them as the <i>Genii</i>, or Guardians of the Place: Not only
Men, but every kind of Things, had its peculiar <i>Genius</i>. Two
were assigned to each Person, a good and evil Genius, and those
were thought to attend them from the Cradle to the Grave. We
read of a sacred Dragon that was kept in <i>Phrygia</i> in <i>Asia Minor</i>,
whose Residence was in a Wood, dedicated to <i>Diana</i>, Goddess
of the Woods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among other strange Animals in the <i>East-Indies</i>, <i>Alexander</i>
found in a Cave, a <i>monstrous Dragon</i>, which the Inhabitants
counted sacred, and was adored by them, and daily supplied with
Food: The poor, ignorant, superstitious People, humbly addrest
the <i>Conqueror</i>, not to attack that <i>holy Place</i>, and disturb the Repose
of their God. The victorious Army hearing its hideous and
dreadful Roarings, were not a little terrify’d; they only saw its
monstrous Head, when stretch’d out of its Mansion, and its Eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>appeared to them to be as big as a large <i>Macedonian Buckler</i>, a

<p class='c013'>The King of <i>Calicut</i> (in the <i>East-Indies</i>, the most powerful
of all the <i>Malabar</i> Princes) causes little Cottages to be erected
for sacred Serpents, to guard them against the Inclemency of the
Weather, and ’tis made Death to hurt them, being they are look’d
upon as heavenly Spirits; and they believe them to be such for
this Reason, because <i>they kill Men so suddenly by the Wound they
give, which is only a little Puncture, and would not prove fatal if
given by other Creatures</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is observed by some, that Serpents at this day are highly
honour’d in the Kingdom of <i>Calicut</i>, on this side the <i>Ganges</i>,
where the Inhabitants call their King <i>Samori</i>, or <i>Zamorin</i>, that
is, Sovereign Emperor, and God upon Earth. The Dragon being
a Serpent of the vigilant Tribe, was constituted and made
Guardian of their Houses, of their oracular Temples, and of all
their Treasures.</p>

<p class='c013'>These Protectors of Places and Possessions, they call’d Tutelary
Gods, and were worshipp’d by them under the Symbol of
<i>Serpents</i>, without whose Sanction no Methods of Protection were
available.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is remarkable, that where the Figure of two Serpents was
erected in any place, it was look’d upon as a Sign of consecrated
Ground; that is, that the Place was holy, being dedicated to some
God; for which Superstition they are ridiculed by one of their own
Writers, <i>viz.</i> <i>Persius</i> the Satirist, that lived under <i>Nero</i>, who
tells us, that Children were forbid to empty themselves in those
Places, and not so much as make-water, for the Place is holy,
as appears by the <i>Picture of the two Serpents</i>; the Language of
which is, Profane not holy Ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Epiroticks</i>, who highly venerated <i>Apollo</i>, honour’d his
Temple with a <i>consecrated Dragon</i>, which they worshipp’d in solemn
remembrance of his killing the <i>Pythonic Serpent</i>. It were
well if the same Spirit of Gratitude reign’d amongst <i>Britons</i>, towards
the Heroes that deliver’d their Country from the great Ecclesiastical
Dragon, by the glorious Revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Near <i>Lavinium</i> was a Grove of serpentine Gods, dedicated
to <i>Juno</i> of <i>Argos</i>, which was a City in <i>Peloponnesus</i> (famous for
the Shrine of <i>Æsculapius</i>) now the <i>Morea</i>, one of whose Rivers is
called <i>Styx</i>; or rather a Well, whose Water is so cold and venemous,
that it often kills such that drink thereof; and therefore
design’d by the Poets, to be a River of Hell: ’Tis said by some,
that <i>Alexander</i> was poison’d with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s well known what Worship was paid to the Serpent at
<i>Epidaurus</i>, a <i>Peleponnesian City</i>, and the Manner how ’twas pretended
that Serpent was brought to <i>Rome</i>, which is as follows,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Romans</i> being sorely distrest by a Plague, they sent a
<i>Galley</i> with Ambassadors to <i>Epidaurus</i>, to bring the Serpent consecrated
to <i>Æsculapius</i> to <i>Rome</i>, which of its own accord went
aboard the Galley, and which was landed in the Isle of <i>Tyber</i>,
where divine Honours were paid to it; upon which the Plague
ceased.——Take it as represented by the Historian, who says,
... That the Plague raging terribly at <i>Rome</i>, and in the
Vicinity, above three Years, did not abate, by any divine or human
Remedy, tho’ Men had tried both; therefore by the Counsel
of the <i>Delphic Oracle</i>, ten Ambassadors were sent to fetch
the Statue of <i>Æsculapius</i>, that was ador’d in the Body of the great
Serpent; hereupon, a very strange thing ensued, and manifestly
true, both from many faithful Historians, and building the <i>Temple</i>
(dedicated to it) in the <i>Isle of Tyber</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the <i>Roman Ambassadors</i> had delivered their Commands
to the <i>Epidaurians</i>, who brought them into the Temple of <i>Æsculapius</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span> ... while they were admiring a huge Shrine, a great
Serpent sliding of a sudden from the <i>Adytum</i> (which was a Place
of Retirement in the Pagan Temples, where Oracles were given,
into which none but Priests were admitted) upon sight of it the
Priests, in a devout Posture, said to the Company, <i>that the Deity
shrouded itself in that Form</i>, and when it appear’d in this <i>Fashion</i>,
’twas look’d upon as a <i>happy Omen</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpent was seen for two Days in the Temple, and afterwards
disappeared, but on the third Day it past thro’ the Croud
(which gazed on and worship’d) and went directly to the Port
where the <i>Roman Galley</i> stood; and having enter’d into it, laid
itself down in the Cabin of <i>Q. Ogulnius</i>, the chief Ambassador.
They set sail from thence ... and soon arrived at <i>Rome</i>. The
whole City came out to see this wonderful Thing——Altars were
built, Incense burnt, and Sacrifices offer’d. The Serpent swam
over to the <i>Isle of Tyber</i>, (which afterwards was called <i>Æsculapius</i>’s
<i>Isle</i>) and since was never seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Senate concluding this Island to be the Place chosen
by the God, decreed that a Temple should be built for <i>Æsculapius</i>
there—whereupon the Plague ceased. The Temple grew famous
for rich Offerings, in Consideration of their Deliverance
from the Plague by that Deity<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c019'><sup>[400]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Serpent of <i>Æsculapius</i>, the reputed God of Physick, had

counted sacred to <i>Æsculapius</i>, and were cicur’d, or made tame by
human Arts. A <i>Dragon</i> was usually annex’d to his <i>Image</i>, and
to that of <i>Health</i>, nothing being thought <i>available</i> without the

<p class='c013'>At <i>Pella</i> in <i>Macedonia</i>, the Royal Seat, and <i>Alexander</i>’s Birth-place,
were <i>Dragons</i> of a large Bulk, but of a gentle Nature,

Account of the Origin of the <i>Apotheosis</i>, or <i>Canonization of Serpents</i><a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c019'><sup>[408]</sup></a>;
which leads me to say something of what the Ancients
called <i>Apotheosis of departed Souls</i>, and the Strange Ceremonies
used in the <i>Apotheosis</i> or <i>Deification</i> of the deceased Emperor, who
had deserved well of their Country.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f408'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r408'>408</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Sanchoniathon</i> is supposed by some to be
cotemporary with <i>Gideon</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><i>APOTHEOSIS</i> among the Ancients was a Pagan Ceremony
whereby Emperors and great Men were placed among the
Gods, called also <i>Deification</i>, and <i>Consecration</i>: Temples and
Altars were erected to the new Deities, <i>viz.</i> Serpents and Men,
Sacrifices offered to them; and for that end, Colleges of Priests
were instituted for the Honour of these Demi-Gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the Doctrines of <i>Pythagoras</i>, which he borrowed
from the <i>Chaldeans</i>, that useful and virtuous Persons, after
their Death, were raised into the <i>Order of the Gods</i>. Hence the
Ancients <i>deified</i> all the Inventors of Things that were beneficial
to Mankind, and those who had done Services of Importance to
their Country.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees these <i>new Gods</i> grew very numerous. One of
their own Poets rallying them for frequent Deifications, introduces
poor <i>Atlas</i>, who is said to <i>bear the Heavens on his Shoulders</i>,
complaining, that he was ready to sink under the Number and
Weight of so many <i>new Gods</i>, as were every day coin’d, and
added to the Heavens, which made his Shoulders to warch.
<i>N. B.</i> <i>Atlas</i> in Anatomy is the Name of the first <i>Vertebra</i> of the
Neck, which supports the Head, and is the highest, so called in
allusion to the famous Mountain <i>Atlas</i> in <i>Africa</i>, suppos’d to be
the highest in the World, so that it seems to hold up the Heavens;
and also to the Fable that makes <i>Atlas</i> King of <i>Mauritania</i>
in that Country, to bear up the visible Heavens. I now
proceed to the Description which we have in <i>Herodian</i>, a <i>Greek</i>
Historian in the third Century, who in speaking of the <i>Apotheosis</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of the Emperor <i>Severus</i>, gives us a very full Account of that strange
Ceremony, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>... After the Body of the deceased Emperor had been
burnt with the usual Solemnities, they placed an Image of Wax
perfectly like him, but of a sickly Aspect, on a large Bed of
Ivory, covered with Cloth of Gold, which they exposed to publick
View at the Entrance of the Palace-Gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest Part of the Day the Senate sat ranged on the
left side of the Bed, drest in Mourning Robes; the Ladies of
the first Rank sitting on the right side, in plain and white Robes,
without any Ornaments.... This lasted for seven Days successively;
during which, the Physicians came from time to time to
visit the Sick, always making their Report that he grew worse,
till at length they publish’d it, that he was dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>This done, the <i>young Senators</i> and <i>Roman Knights</i> took the
Bed of State upon their Shoulders, carrying it thro’ the <i>Via sacra</i>
to the old <i>Forum</i>, where the Magistrates used to divest themselves
of their Offices: There they let it down between two kinds
of Amphitheatres; in the one, were the Youth, and in the other
the Maidens of the first Families in <i>Rome</i>, singing Hymns set to
solemn Airs in praise of the Deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those Hymns ended, the Bed was carried out of the City
into the <i>Campus Martius</i>, in the middle of which Place was erected
a kind of square Pavilion; the Inside thereof was full of
combustible Matter, and the Outside hung with Cloth of Gold,
and adorned with Figures of Ivory, and various Paintings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over this Edifice were several others, like the first in Form
and Decoration, but less; always diminishing, and growing slenderer
towards the Top, and a great many aromatick Perfumes,
and odoriferous Fruits and Herbs were thrown all around: After
which, the Knights made a Procession in solemn Measures about
the Pile; several Chariots ran round it, those who conducted
them being clad in purple Robes, and bearing the Images of the
greatest <i>Roman</i> Emperors and Generals.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Ceremony ended, the new Emperor came to the <i>Catafalco</i>
or Pile with a Torch in his hand, and at the same time
Fire was put to it on all sides by the Company, the Spices and
all Combustibles kindling all at once. While this was doing,
they let fly from the Top of the Building an <i>Eagle</i>, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>mounting into the Air with a Firebrand, carried the Soul of the
dead Emperor along with it into Heaven, as the <i>Romans</i> believ’d;
and thenceforward <i>he was ranked among the Gods</i>. ’Tis for this
Reason that the Medals wherein the <i>Apotheoses</i> are represented,
have usually an Altar with Fire upon it, or however an Eagle
taking its Flight into the Air, and sometimes two Eagles<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c019'><sup>[409]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A certain Emperor being asked, what he had done to
merit an <i>Apotheosis</i>? He answered, <i>He had always studied to resemble
the Gods</i>. And being asked again, In what did he endeavour
to be like them? He answered, <i>In having as few Wants
as possible of my own, and doing good in the most extensive Way to
others</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no Place so remote in the World, but has been
polluted with this monstrous Idolatry, <i>of worshipping Serpents</i>.
The northern Historians tell us, the People of <i>Lithuania</i> in <i>Poland</i>
worship’d Serpents; and ’tis not long ago, since that gross
Idolatry was abolish’d, of which <i>Sigismund</i> Baron of <i>Herberstein</i>,
gives us this memorable Story, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>——Returning, says he, from <i>Massovia</i> near <i>Wilna</i>, my
Host acquainted me, he had bought a Hive of Bees, from one
of these <i>Serpent-Worshippers</i>, whom with much ado he had persuaded
to kill the Serpent, and worship the true God: Within
a while after coming that Way, he found the poor Fellow miserably
tortured and deformed, his Face wrinkl’d and turn’d awry;
and demanding the Cause of it, he answer’d, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>THAT this Judgment was inflicted upon him for killing his
God</i>, and that he was like to endure heavier Torments if he did
not return to his former Worship. Which brings to my Mind
a Passage in one of the Fathers, relating to the <i>Carthaginians</i>,
who having been compelled by <i>Agathocles</i> King of <i>Sicily</i> to
leave off those horrid Sacrifices of human Victims to <i>Saturn</i>, forbore
them a long time: But a great Calamity being brought
upon them for disusing those human Sacrifices; and to atone
for their Neglect, <i>they sacrificed at once two hundred Children of
the noblest Families in</i> Carthage<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c019'><sup>[410]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>English</i> Cosmographer accounts for them thus, <i>viz.</i>
“The People anciently had <i>Fire</i> and <i>Serpents</i> for their Gods,
nourishing the last in their Houses, and keeping the other

Fuel, that it might not fail. The Vestal Fire was not kept
more carefully at <i>Rome</i>, nor with greater Ceremony.... To

to sacrifice young Pullets, to the other their Cocks<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c019'><sup>[412]</sup></a>.” The

<p class='c044'><i>Reasons for worshipping Serpents, seem to rise from Misapplication
of some Scripture Passages: But especially, 1. From the Triumphs
of the Paradisaic Serpent. Pagan History from</i> Moses.
<i>In the primitive Church, a Sect of Christians worship’d Serpents,
and said the Serpent in Paradise was a good Creature. 2.
From the miraculous Cures done by the brazen Serpent.</i> Alexander
<i>affected the Honour of being begot by a Serpent, ador’d as a
God, by a Decree of the Priests.</i></p>

<p class='c033'><i>WHAT Reason can be assigned for giving religious Worship
to Serpents?</i> I answer,</p>

<p class='c013'>It is no easy Matter to find out the Original of Pagan Idolatry,
having no authentick Records of those remote Times, therefore
Conjectures, or nothing must content the honest Enquirer:
Something may be offer’d, without going beyond our Depth.
Before I proceed, it may be proper to observe, <i>viz.</i> That Knowledge
sprung from the Sons of <i>Noah</i>, who doubtless instructed
their Successors in the History of the Creation, the Conquest of
Paradise by a Serpent, that introduced the Knowledge of Good
and Evil upon Earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those whom we call <i>Heathens</i>, at first were Members of the
true Church; the further Men went from the Spring, the Streams
grew more muddy, and strange Constructions were put upon the
History of <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>, <i>Noah</i>, and his Progeny, which in process
of Time was metamorphosed into a Narrative of Fooleries and
fabulous Gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the <i>Mosaick</i> History of their Travels thro’ the Wilderness,
and the Promulgation of the Law upon Mount <i>Sinai</i>, were strange
and stupendous Events, that soon spread over the Nations in some
Shape or other.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>Phœnician Theology</i>, we find the Creation described,
almost in the Terms used by <i>Moses</i>. <i>Diodorus Siculus</i> says, the
Antients liv’d upon Roots and Fruits. The <i>Phœnician</i> Records
mention <i>Ujoris</i>, <i>i. e.</i> <i>Adam</i>, the first that wore Garments
made of Animal Skins. The <i>Vulcan</i> of the Heathen was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span><i>Tubal-cain</i> of <i>Moses</i>, (<i>Gen.</i> iv. 22.) the first Artificer in Brass and
Iron: <i>Plato</i>’s <i>Atlanticus</i> is a Fable founded upon the History of
<i>Noah</i>’s Flood: The Fable of the Giants storming Heaven, is taken
from the Builders of the Tower of <i>Babel</i>, as before: Yea,
says a Learned Father (after <i>Numenius</i>, the celebrated <i>Pythagorean</i>
and <i>Platonist</i>) what is <i>Plato</i> but <i>Moses in an Athenian Dress</i><a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c019'><sup>[419]</sup></a>?
But to be more particular,</p>

<div class='fn'>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r419'>419</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Τι γαρ εστι Πλατων η Μωσης αττικιζων. <i>Quid
enim est Plato, nisi Moses qui loquitur Atticè?</i> Or, <i>Quid enim

</div>

<p class='c013'>1. <i>SATAN</i>, who conducted the War in <i>Eden</i>, display’d his Art
under the Form of a Serpent, which <i>Moses</i> represents as a Creature
of superior Wisdom, and Illuminator of Mankind. Now the
Tradition, that the <i>first Serpent</i> had not only the Gift of speaking,
but of communicating Science, and had held a Conference with
the first Woman, to the vast Increase of her Knowledge, might
at last swell to such a degree, that ignorant People might attribute
to that Serpent, and her Race, a kind of Divinity; and for
this Reason also, because in the Perfections of the Mind she exceeded
our first Parents, who being constituted Governors of the
Earth, must be supposed to be furnish’d with extraordinary Accomplishments:
But, says Tradition, here is one who infused
greater Knowledge into them, and made them more wise; and
they, for contesting with the <i>Wisdom of the Serpent</i>, were turned
out of Paradise, and ordain’d their Dwelling to be among the
Beasts of the Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Surely, might the People say, so great a Being as this Serpent
merits our awful Regards. Now, how far such Thoughts
might operate in those early days of Ignorance and Superstition,
I determine not: The Serpent indeed, is said to be more subtle
than the Beasts of the Field, but not more wise than <i>Adam</i> and
<i>Eve</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is more strange, to think that in the primitive Church there
were certain Hereticks call’d <i>Ophites</i>, took their Name from
<i>Ophis</i><a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c019'><sup>[420]</sup></a>, who worshipped the Serpent that betray’d <i>Eve</i>, and ascribed
all sorts of Knowledge to that Animal, maintain’d ’twas a
good Creature, and that our first Parents were instructed by it to
know Good and Evil. Yea, they believed, “the Serpent that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>tempted <i>Eve</i> was the <i>Christ</i>, who afterwards came down and
was incarnate in the Person of <i>Jesus</i>: That it was <i>Jesus</i>, but
not the <i>Christ</i>, that suffer’d; for which reason they made all
Proselytes to their Sect, to renounce Jesus<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c019'><sup>[421]</sup></a>.” If a Sect of
Christians speak after this manner, what Ideas must the Heathen

<p class='c013'>2. The Reputation gain’d by the Serpent in Paradise, was heighten’d
by the wonderful Cures done by the brazen Serpent in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Wilderness. As this strange Occurrence was capable of various
Glosses, so it must undergo different Constructions. The <i>Brazen
Serpent</i> was brought to <i>Canaan</i>, where ’twas kept in remembrance
of the miraculous Cures their Forefathers had received from it in
the Wilderness; and, ’tis probable, the <i>Israelites</i> themselves were
the first that paid divine Honours to it, and the Idolatry might
begin in the days of the Judges; others say, under the Kings of
<i>Judah</i><a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c019'><sup>[426]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It lay quiet there, <i>until those Days, the Children of Israel burnt
Incense to it</i>. That is, from the days <i>Israel</i> began to commit
Idolatry, to the days of <i>Hezekiah</i>; who, to prevent the Growth
of that Serpentine Idolatry, <i>brake in pieces the brazen Serpent that
Moses had made</i>. 2 Kings xviii. 4.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sound of the strange Cures done by the <i>brazen Serpent</i>,
soon spread over the forsaken Nations, who, observing how the
Wounded were healed by looking at it, conceived it to be a proper
Instrument to be their Mediator, and consequently a fit Object
for their Adoration, when even the Wounded in <i>Israel</i>, by addressing
to its Shadow, were healed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is most probable, that the Adoration of Serpents by the
Pagans, sprung from these two Fountains,</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Wisdom of the Serpent</i> in Paradise, and the <i>miraculous
Cures</i> done by the <i>Shadow of a Serpent</i> in the Wilderness; which
were improved by the Devil to secure his Honour and Interest,
who wanted not Priests to display the Glories of their Character,
to make the Serpent honourable in the sight of his Vassals. From
hence, the <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Phenicians</i>, yea most Nations, did imagine
the Serpent to have some <i>Divinity in its Nature</i>, and for that
reason (as hinted before) honour’d it with sacred Homage; this
the Devil did, with a view to lessen Men’s Esteem for the Almighty
Creator.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hence also some Men of superior Dignity have affected to
be esteem’d more than meer Men, making this as an Argument,
that they were <i>begot by Serpents</i>, as we observed already, therefore
I shall only add, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>That <i>Alexander the Great</i>, after he had taken <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Egypt</i>
and <i>Cilicia</i>, addrest <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> to know his Original, for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Mother <i>Olympias</i> had confest to his Father <i>Philip</i>, that <i>Alexander</i>
was not begot by him, but by a <i>Serpent</i> of <i>vast Bulk</i>; whereupon
<i>Philip</i> was divorced from his Wife <i>Olympias</i>, and <i>Alexander</i>
was saluted Son of <i>Ammon</i>, and by Order of the Priests, his Companions
were enjoin’d to worship him as a <i>God</i>, and not as a
<i>King</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>ALEXANDER</i>, when he had conquer’d <i>Darius</i> III. surnam’d
<i>Codomannus</i>, and was possest of the <i>Persian</i> Empire, writ to the
<i>Grecians</i>, that they should <i>decree him to be a God</i>. Hereupon
several Decrees were made: The <i>Lacedemonians</i> exprest their
Compliance in this short Decree, <i>viz.</i> <i>Forasmuch as</i> Alexander
<i>would be a God, let him be a God</i>. Thus with Laconick Brevity,

<p class='c044'><i>Reasons for worshipping hurtful as well as useful Creatures, founded
on a Notion of two eternal contrary Principles: They believe God
was good, and could not be the Author of moral Evil, therefore
fram’d the Ditheistical Doctrine; an Error, espoused by some
primitive Christians, confuted by the Sentence past upon the Serpent.
Reasons for worshipping different Species of Animals by
the</i> Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c033'>Whence arises the Honour given by Heathens to different
Species of Beings, to the noxious and hurtful, as
well as to the salutary and beneficent Tribe?</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably, it might be from their observing the <i>Mixtures
of Good and Evil</i> in the visible Creation, when as yet in their
infantile State of Knowledge: The reason of this they could not
otherwise account for, but by giving into the Notion of <i>two distinct
independent governing Powers</i>; the one a good, the other an evil
Genius: accordingly they worshipped Creatures that were useful,
as being the Ministers of the good Genius; and those that were
hurtful they paid Homage to, out of servile Fear, and to ingratiate
themselves into their Favour. In the Morning they worshipped
the <i>celestial Gods</i>; in the Evening, the <i>infernal</i>: On the
Plain they worshipped the terrestrial Gods, on Hills the supernatural;
in Grotos and Caves, the infernal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hence it is they asserted a Duplicity of Gods, <i>viz.</i> Two
perceptive self-existent Beings, one the Principle of Good, and
the other of Evil. This Opinion originally sprung from a strong,
firm Persuasion, <i>That God was invariably Good, and therefore could
not possibly be the Author of the Evil upon Earth</i>. Nor could they
otherwise solve the Difficulty about the Entrance of moral Evil
into our World, but by supposing another eternal self-existent evil
Cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yea, some among the primitive Christians fell into the Error
of asserting this <i>Ditheistical</i> Doctrine; that is, two self-existent
Principles in the Universe, to wit, a <i>good God</i>, and an <i>evil Demon</i>.
Thus the <i>Cerdonites</i>, an heretical Sect, that sprung up in the second
Century, held there were two Gods; one, the Author of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>all good, the other, of all evil Things. So the <i>Marcionites</i> held
two contrary Gods; and in the third Century, the <i>Manichees</i>
did the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, this might be one reason why God past Sentence
upon the Devil in the Serpent, in the presence and hearing of our
first Parents, <i>viz.</i> to prevent the Error of imagining that there
was any Principle of Evil, which was independent upon the Almighty.
The Sentence past upon Satan in the Curse upon the
Serpent, was a Conviction to <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> of his Dependency
upon the Almighty Creator, before whose Tribunal he now was
constrained to appear, to receive the Sentence merited by those,
who make a Lye, and tempt their Fellow-creatures to rebel.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>REASONS about the Adoration of different kind of Animals
by the</i> Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c013'>If you ask, that if they worshipped a Serpent, why did they
pay religious Honours to so many other Beasts? I answer, This
monstrous Idolatry begun in <i>Egypt</i>, and the first occasion for it
seems to be this, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>OSIRIS</i>, a certain King of <i>Egypt</i>, who reign’d with great
Equity and Mildness, having divided his Kingdom into several
distinct Provinces, appointed Presidents over them, and in their
Banners he placed the Figures, or Pictures of certain Animals, that
bore some Similitude to the Peculiarities of those Countries, over
which they were to preside: Thus to the Governor, whose Land
was proper for Tillage, he design’d an <i>Ox</i> in his Standard, to
which the Inhabitants of that Place paid a particular Veneration,
which in process of time was worshipped by the whole Nation,
for its Usefulness, and as the Symbol of Agriculture: Hence the
Image of <i>Osiris</i> is set off with Horns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>golden Calf</i> which <i>Aaron</i> made in the Wilderness, and
the Calves set up by <i>Jeroboam</i> to be worshipped in his Kingdom,
were an Imitation of the idolatrous Adoration, which the <i>Egyptians</i>
paid to their <i>Bull Apis</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>That part of the Country, in which was abundance of Water,
the King set a <i>Crocodile</i> (an amphibious Animal) in his Banner,
that was to govern there, which was had in high Veneration,
especially in the City of <i>Mira</i>; and at last the <i>Crocodile</i> was
worshipped all over <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Where the Country abounded with Wood, a <i>Dog</i> was fixt
in the Governor’s Standard, to which the <i>Egyptians</i> gave no little
Veneration, especially Sportsmen ... as the Poet observes<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c019'><sup>[430]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c031'>That which gives some colour to this Partition of <i>Osiris</i>’s
Kingdom, is, “that God ordained very near the same thing to be
observed in the Encampments of the <i>Israelites</i>, when he divided
the twelve Tribes into four Bodies, and allotted to one of the
three Tribes, belonging to each Body, <i>the Figure of an Animal
to be placed in the Banner</i>: Thus, that of <i>Reuben</i> carried the
Figure of a <i>Man</i>; that of <i>Judah</i>, a <i>Lion</i>; that of <i>Dan</i>, an
<i>Eagle</i>; and that of <i>Ephraim</i>, an <i>Ox</i><a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c019'><sup>[431]</sup></a>”.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r431'>431</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Jurieu’s Crit. Hist.</i> vol. ii.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>After this manner the <i>Egyptian</i> Monarch did place in their
Banners the Figures of certain Animals, which by degrees were
usher’d into their Religion and Temples.
<i>N. B.</i> These Banners thus painted with different Animals,
were fixt upon Poles, between their several Provinces, by which
their Bounds were determined. <i>Semiramis</i>, being conquered by
<i>Staurobates</i>, Antiquity feign’d she was changed by the Gods into
a Dove, the Bird of <i>Venus</i>, which is the reason why the <i>Dove</i>
was worshipped by the <i>Babylonians</i>, and why they gave it in their
Ensign.</p>

<p class='c013'>I Conclude this Part with some Instances, that are given of
the Sottishness of <i>Pagans</i> in what they called religious Worship,
which indeed is almost incredible, if they were not common, and
well attested.—— The <i>Egyptians</i> did not only worship variety of
Beasts, but also the Figures of them, as the Representatives of
their Gods: Each City and District entertain’d a peculiar Devotion
for some particular Beast or other, in honour of which they
built Temples; yea, every one of the <i>Pagan Deities</i> had his own
Beast, Tree and Plant consecrated to him. Thus the <i>Pigeon</i> was
consecrated to <i>Venus</i>; the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Owl</i> to <i>Minerva</i>; the <i>Eagle</i>
to <i>Jupiter</i>; the <i>Cock</i> to <i>Æsculapius</i> and the <i>Sun</i>. This, says <i>Jurieu</i>,
is the true Origin of the <i>Egyptian Idolatry</i>. <i>Ibid.</i> Who
adds, The <i>Egyptians</i> assign’d to their Gods certain Animals, as
their Representatives, and being introduced into the Temples,
as the Images were in some Christian Churches, they at last began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to worship them. This points out the Impiety of admitting
any symbolical Representations of Divinity into Places of publick
Worship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing more monstrous than the <i>Divinity</i> of the <i>Pagans</i>;
their Gods were innumerable. Every thing on <i>Earth</i>, in the
<i>Sea</i>, in the <i>Heavens</i>, yea, and in <i>Hell</i>, had their <i>peculiar Gods</i>.
If <i>Egyptians</i>, who past for the wisest of Mortals, paid religious
Adoration to <i>meer Animals</i>, not only to Serpents, but Apes,
Wolves, yea, Dogs, Cats, ... and to Vegetables, as Onions,
Garlick ... what shall we think of stupid Nations, who had no
Claim to Wisdom?</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in <i>Athens</i> (that celebrated Fountain of Light) were
more Idols than in all <i>Greece</i>; yea, so numerous were their Idols,
that they had almost as many Gods as Men<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c019'><sup>[432]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>STRABO</i>, <i>Procopius</i>, and <i>Ben Jonas</i> say, the antient <i>Persians</i>
kept and worshipped their <i>perpetual Fire</i> on Mount <i>Albors</i>,
a Branch of <i>Caucasus</i>. The <i>Japonese</i> worship the Devil, and the
Head of their Religion is called <i>Dair</i>, whom they worship as a
God. <i>Atlas.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>I Should rather think the <i>Persians</i> ador’d the supreme God,
under the Image of <i>Fire</i>, by reason ’tis Fire gives Motion to every
thing in Nature, and therefore they made it an Emblem of Divinity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Hebrews</i> kept up the <i>holy Fire</i> in the <i>Temple</i>, and the
<i>Vestals</i> were appointed to keep the sacred Fire of the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>VULCAN</i> was worshipped among the Antients, and particularly
the <i>Egyptians</i>, as the <i>Inventor of Fire</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The People of <i>Egypt</i> exceeded most Nations in depreciating
Divinity by gross Superstitions and Idolatry; they did not err in
worshipping Mortals only, but they gave Reverence to Beasts,
Birds, Insects, Winds, Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Plants, <i>&amp;c.</i>

<i>Tarquinius Priscus</i> that followed the Vanity of the <i>Grecians</i> (a
Nation of all others, excepting <i>Egypt</i>, most deluded by the old
Serpent) set up the Images of their Gods, which even the Learned
<i>Varro</i> bewailed and condemned. The <i>Mahometans</i> have a perfect
Aversion to Images. The <i>Jews</i> hate all Images, will not allow
any in their Houses, much less in Places of Worship. But to

<p class='c013'>The apostate <i>Indians</i> worship both Gods and Devils, over
which they acknowledge a Supreme, who sends forth other Deities
as his Deputies; which they think to be the Souls of good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Men; and Devils, the Souls of the Wicked.... They imagine
the Sun and Moon to be Gods; their Idols are represented as

<p class='c013'>“In the Kingdom of <i>Pegu</i> in the East, the People are exceeding
superstitious, and scruple not to worship the Devil, whom
they reckon the Author of Evil; as they do God, of Good:
And in all Calamities, their first Addresses are to the evil Spirit,
for Deliverance; and they make Vows to him, which they
perform upon their Recovery, with the Assistance of their
Priests, whom they call the Devil’s Father, and he directs them
to make sacred Feasts with Musick.” Many of them run about
in the Morning with a Torch in one Hand, and Rice in the
other; pretending to give the Devil his Breakfast, that he may
not hurt them that Day. Others at their Meals, throw part of
what they have over their Shoulders, to feed him, before they
eat any themselves. <i>Ibid.</i> p. 662.</p>

<p class='c013'>At <i>Tavay</i> in that Country, they replenish their Houses with
Victuals, and leave them for three Months, that the Devils may
dwell and feed there, and be favourable all the rest of the Year.
<i>ibid.</i> They have a sort of Monks called <i>Talapoins</i>, who endeavour
to root out this Devil Worship, but without effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Aruspices</i>, were an <i>Order</i> of <i>Priests</i> among the antient
<i>Romans</i>, who pretended to foretell Events, chiefly by inspecting
the Entrails of Beasts killed in Sacrifice ... Birds, and celestial
Appearances. <i>Cato</i>, who was one of the <i>Augurs</i>, conscious of
their impious Politicks, used to say, <i>He wondered how one Priest
could look at another without laughing in his Face</i>. These Augural
Priests made a College, or Community; they bore an Augural
Staff or Wand, called <i>Lituus</i>, made in form of a <i>Crozier</i>, or a
Bishop’s Staff, or Shepherd’s Crook, as the Ensign of their Office
and Authority—— And what is most ridiculous is, that no Affair
of Moment could be resolved upon, without first consulting these
holy Cheats; and their Advice, be what it would, was by a Decree
of the Senate appointed to be exactly and religiously observed.
<i>Ornithomancy</i>, or Divination by Birds, was, among the <i>Greeks</i>,
the same with <i>Augury</i> among the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>At <i>Angola</i> and <i>Congo</i> in the <i>East-Indies</i>, wooden Idols, resembling
Negroes, are erected in the midst of their Towns, which
they daily worship. ’Tis their Belief they are never sick, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>when their Idols are angry with them; therefore to appease them,
they pour at their Feet the <i>Wine of Palms</i>. They wash, paint,
and new cloath their Dead, and bury with them Meat, Drink,
and some of their Goods, and sprinkle the Grave with the Blood
of Goats. Their Priests are in such high Esteem, that they think
Plenty and Famine, Life and Death, are in their power<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c019'><sup>[439]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old Inhabitants of <i>Virginia</i> believed many Gods, but
one principally, who made the rest ... and that the Woman
was made before the Man, and propagated by the Help of one
of the inferior Gods. The Natives are <i>Anthropomorphites</i>, giving
to their Gods the Forms of Men.... When they go abroad,
they carry their Gods about with them, and in Matters of Doubt
ask Counsel of them. Much of their Devotion consists in howling
and dancing about Fires, with Rattles in their Hands.

<p class='c013'>Another Instance of monstrous Degeneracy, we have among
the <i>Phenicians</i>, who offer’d yearly Sacrifices to <i>Saturn</i> of
young <i>Infants</i>; and in the Temple of <i>Venus</i>, practised not only
Whoredom, but the most unnatural Sin of Sodomy also; yea,
by the Laws of their Religion, were bound to prostitute their
Daughters to <i>Venus</i>, before they married them: In their Temple
the Women who refused to be shaved, were obliged to yield up
their Honour to Strangers for one day.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Country, now called <i>New Spain</i>, the old Inhabitants
would neither eat nor drink, till they had cast towards the Sun,
some part of their Food; nor would they smell a Flower, without
throwing up in the Air some Leaves of it, thereby acknowledging
the Gods to be their great Benefactors: Tho’ this be ridiculous,
yet having an Air of religious Gratitude, it is commendable.
Among other Idols ador’d at <i>Mexico</i>, they had one
called <i>Vitziliputzli</i>, placed in an azure colour’d Chair, with <i>Serpent’s
Heads</i> at each Corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yea the Pagans, to authorize their own Crimes, and justify
their vicious Lives, have constituted licentious, drunken, vicious
Gods, <i>&amp;c.</i> Instances of this kind we have in their religious Institutions,
as the <i>Saturnalia</i> of the <i>Romans</i>, which were Feasts
sacred to the God <i>Saturn</i>: This Feast was observed in <i>December</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>at first kept for one day, then for three days, and afterwards for
seven days. So sacred was this Festival, that while it lasted, no
Criminals were to be executed, no War to begin.... And yet at
the same time, a Sanction was given to universal Debauchery; all
Rules of Virtue and common Decency were intirely banished, and
all things run into a wild Scene of Distraction and Lewdness, and
all this under the Umbrage of doing Honour to their Gods<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c019'><sup>[441]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same Game was acted in the <i>Lupercalian</i> Feasts, instituted
in honour of the God <i>Pan</i> (under the shape of a <i>Goat</i>) whose
Priests, on the Morning of the Feast, ran naked thro’ the Streets,
striking the married Women they met, on the Hands and Belly
with <i>Straps</i> cut out of <i>Goats Skins</i>, which was held an Omen,
promising Fruitfulness, and happy Deliveries.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall only add the <i>Bacchanalian</i> Feasts, celebrated in honour
of <i>Bacchus</i>, the God of Wine, and Master of the Revels;
sometimes called <i>Orgia</i><a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c019'><sup>[442]</sup></a>, from a <i>Greek</i> Word that signifies Anger
and Rage, because in the Celebration of it, People acted in so raging
and furious a manner, as if they had been absolutely distracted.
These religious Feasts were not only encumber’d with a great number
of Ceremonies, but attended with most notorious Dissoluteness;
for Men and Women met at them, all naked, except their Heads
and Hips, that were shaded with Vine Leaves.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Women, who were installed Priestesses, during this Feast,
ran thro’ the Streets, and other Places, cover’d with Tyger’s Skins,
Scepters in one Hand, and Torches in the other, howling and roaring
out the Praise of <i>Bacchus</i>, with Hair dishevell’d, dangling about
their Shoulders. They were call’d <i>Mœnades</i> from their Madness,
<i>Thyades</i> from their Rage, <i>Bacchæ</i> from their Intemperance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Poets tell us, that in the <i>Bacchanalian Train</i>, were a
Croud of <i>Nymphs</i> and <i>Naiades</i>, a sort of Heathen Divinities; some
crown’d with Ivy, their Hair loose, and intermix’d with Snakes,
clothed with the Skins of Beasts, and girt about with large Serpents,
and running frantick in the Woods and Mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, their sacred Games, Festivals, and Sacrifices, were
little more than drunken Banquets, nocturnal Revels, tumultuous
Dancings, all wild, ridiculous and extravagant.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        works.

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
